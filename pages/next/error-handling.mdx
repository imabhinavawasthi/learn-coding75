### How to Handle Errors

Errors can be divided into two categories: **expected errors** and **uncaught exceptions**.  
This page will walk you through how you can handle these errors in your Next.js application.

---

### Handling Expected Errors

**Expected errors** are those that can occur during the normal operation of the application, such as those from server-side form validation or failed requests.  
These errors should be handled explicitly and returned to the client.

#### Server Functions

You can use the `useActionState` hook to handle expected errors in **Server Functions**.

For these errors, avoid using `try/catch` blocks and throwing errors. Instead, model expected errors as **return values**.

```tsx
import { useActionState } from 'next/actions';

export default function MyForm() {
  const [state, setState] = useActionState();

  const handleSubmit = async (data) => {
    const result = await fetch('/api/submit', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });

    if (!result.ok) {
      setState({ error: 'Form submission failed' });
    } else {
      setState({ success: 'Form submitted successfully!' });
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form fields */}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      {state.error && <div>{state.error}</div>}
      {state.success && <div>{state.success}</div>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Handling Uncaught Exceptions

**Uncaught exceptions** are unexpected errors that indicate bugs or issues that should not occur during the normal flow of your application.  
These should be handled by throwing errors, which will then be caught by **error boundaries**.

---

#### Nested Error Boundaries

Next.js uses **error boundaries** to handle uncaught exceptions.  
Error boundaries catch errors in their child components and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

---

To create an error boundary, add an `error.js` (or `error.tsx`) file inside a route segment and export a React component:

```tsx
// app/blog/error.js

export default function ErrorBoundary() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong in the Blog section!</h2>
      <p>Sorry, we encountered an error while loading this section.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Global Errors

While less common, you can handle errors in the **root layout** using the `global-error.js` file, located in the root app directory, even when leveraging internationalization.  
The **global error UI** must define its own `<html>` and `<body>` tags since it is replacing the root layout or template when active.

---

#### Example: `app/global-error.tsx`

```tsx
// app/global-error.tsx

export default function GlobalError() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <h1>Something went wrong globally!</h1>
        <p>Sorry, we encountered an error across the entire app.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
