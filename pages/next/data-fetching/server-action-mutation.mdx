# Server Actions and Mutations

Server Actions are asynchronous functions that are executed on the server. They can be called in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions and data mutations in Next.js applications.

## Convention

A Server Action can be defined with the React `"use server"` directive. You can place the directive at the top of an async function to mark the function as a Server Action, or at the top of a separate file to mark all exports of that file as Server Actions.

### Server Components

Server Components can use the inline function level or module level `"use server"` directive. To inline a Server Action, add `"use server"` to the top of the function body:

## Example of a Server Action in Next.js

```typescript
export default function Page() {
  // Server Action
  async function create() {
    'use server'
    // Mutate data
  }

  return '...'
}
```

## Client Components

To call a Server Action in a Client Component, create a new file and add the `"use server"` directive at the top of it. All exported functions within the file will be marked as Server Actions that can be reused in both Client and Server Components:

## Example of Calling a Server Action from a Client Component

```typescript
'use client'

import { create } from './actions'

export function Button() {
  return <button onClick={() => create()}>Create</button>
}
```
## Passing Actions as Props

You can also pass a Server Action to a Client Component as a prop:

## Example of Passing Actions as Props to a Client Component

```typescript
'use client'

export default function ClientComponent({
  updateItemAction,
}: {
  updateItemAction: (formData: FormData) => void
}) {
  return <form action={updateItemAction}>{/* ... */}</form>
}
```
