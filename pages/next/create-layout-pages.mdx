## How to Create Layouts and Pages

Next.js uses file-system based routing, meaning you can use folders and files to define routes.  
This page will guide you through how to create layouts and pages, and link between them.

---

### Creating a Page

A **page** is UI that is rendered on a specific route.  
To create a page, add a page file inside the `app` directory and default export a React component.

For example, to create an **index page** (`/`):

```jsx
// app/page.js (or app/page.tsx if using TypeScript)

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Home Page</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
### Creating a Layout

A **layout** is UI that is shared between multiple pages.  
On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not rerender.

You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a `layout.js` (or `layout.tsx`) file.  
The component should accept a `children` prop, which can be a page or another layout.

For example, to create a layout that accepts your index page as a child, add a `layout.js` file inside the `app` directory:

```jsx
// app/layout.js

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <header>
          <h1>My Website Header</h1>
        </header>
        <main>{children}</main>
        <footer>
          <p>Â© 2025 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
        </footer>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
### Creating a Nested Route

A **nested route** is a route composed of multiple URL segments.  
For example, the `/blog/[slug]` route is composed of three segments:

- `/` (Root Segment)
- `blog` (Segment)
- `[slug]` (Leaf Segment)

---

In Next.js:

- **Folders** are used to define the route segments that map to URL segments.
- **Files** (like `page` and `layout`) are used to create the UI that is shown for a segment.

---

To create nested routes, you can nest folders inside each other.  
For example, to add a route for `/blog`, create a folder called `blog` in the `app` directory.  
Then, to make `/blog` publicly accessible, add a `page.tsx` file:

```tsx
// app/blog/page.tsx

export default function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Blog</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Nesting Layouts

By default, layouts in the folder hierarchy are also nested,  
which means they wrap child layouts via their `children` prop.  

You can nest layouts by adding a `layout.js` (or `layout.tsx`) file inside specific route segments (folders).

For example, to create a layout for the `/blog` route, add a new `layout.tsx` file inside the `blog` folder:

```tsx
// app/blog/layout.tsx

export default function BlogLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <section>
      <h2>Blog Section</h2>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </section>
  );
}
```
