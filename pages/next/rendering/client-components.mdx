# Client Components

Client Components allow you to write interactive UI that is prerendered on the server and can use client JavaScript to run in the browser.

This page will go through how Client Components work, how they're rendered, and when you might use them.

## Benefits of Client Rendering

There are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the client, including:

- **Interactivity**: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.
- **Browser APIs**: Client Components have access to browser APIs, like `geolocation` or `localStorage`.

# Using Client Components in Next.js

To use Client Components, you can add the React `"use client"` directive at the top of a file, above your imports.

`"use client"` is used to declare a boundary between a Server and Client Component modules. This means that by defining a `"use client"` in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle.

## Example: `app/counter.tsx`

```typescript
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
The diagram below shows that using `onClick` and `useState` in a nested component (`toggle.js`) will cause an error if the `"use client"` directive is not defined. 

This is because, by default, all components in the **App Router** are **Server Components** where these APIs are not available.

By defining the `"use client"` directive in `toggle.js`, you can tell React to enter the client boundary where these APIs are available.
