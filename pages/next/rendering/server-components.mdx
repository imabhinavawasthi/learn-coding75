### Server Components

React Server Components allow you to write UI that can be rendered and optionally cached on the server.  
In Next.js, the rendering work is further split by route segments to enable streaming and partial rendering, and there are three different server rendering strategies:

- **Static Rendering**
- **Dynamic Rendering**
- **Streaming**

This page will go through how Server Components work, when you might use them, and the different server rendering strategies.

### Benefits of Server Rendering

There are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the server, including:

- **Data Fetching**:  
  Server Components allow you to move data fetching to the server, closer to your data source.  
  This can improve performance by reducing the time it takes to fetch data needed for rendering, and the number of requests the client needs to make.

- **Security**:  
  Server Components allow you to keep sensitive data and logic on the server, such as tokens and API keys, without the risk of exposing them to the client.

- **Caching**:  
  By rendering on the server, the result can be cached and reused on subsequent requests and across users.  
  This can improve performance and reduce costs by reducing the amount of rendering and data fetching done on each request.

- **Performance**:  
  Server Components give you additional tools to optimize performance from the baseline.  
  For example, if you start with an app composed entirely of Client Components, moving non-interactive pieces of your UI to Server Components can reduce the amount of client-side JavaScript needed.  
  This benefits users with slower internet or less powerful devices, as the browser has less client-side JavaScript to download, parse, and execute.

- **Initial Page Load and First Contentful Paint (FCP)**:  
  On the server, we can generate HTML to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse, and execute JavaScript needed to render the page.

- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Social Network Shareability**:  
  The rendered HTML can be used by search engine bots to index your pages and social network bots to generate social card previews for your pages.

- **Streaming**:  
  Server Components allow you to split the rendering work into chunks and stream them to the client as they become ready.  
  This allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having to wait for the entire page to be rendered on the server.

### Switching to Dynamic Rendering

During rendering, if a **Dynamic API** or a `fetch` option of `{ cache: 'no-store' }` is discovered,  
Next.js will switch to dynamically rendering the whole route.

This table summarizes how Dynamic APIs and data caching affect whether a route is statically or dynamically rendered:

### Switching to Dynamic Rendering

During rendering, if a **Dynamic API** or a `fetch` option of `{ cache: 'no-store' }` is discovered,  
Next.js will switch to dynamically rendering the whole route.

This table summarizes how Dynamic APIs and data caching affect whether a route is statically or dynamically rendered:

| Dynamic APIs | Data        | Route                |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| No           | Cached      | Statically Rendered  |
| Yes          | Cached      | Dynamically Rendered |
| No           | Not Cached  | Dynamically Rendered |
| Yes          | Not Cached  | Dynamically Rendered |

In the table above, for a route to be fully static, **all data must be cached**.  
However, you can have a dynamically rendered route that uses both cached and uncached data fetches.

As a developer, you do not need to choose between static and dynamic rendering â€”  
**Next.js will automatically** choose the best rendering strategy for each route based on the features and APIs used.  
Instead, you choose when to **cache** or **revalidate** specific data, and you may choose to **stream** parts of your UI.
