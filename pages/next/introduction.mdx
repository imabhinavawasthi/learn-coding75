Next.js is a popular React framework that extends React’s capabilities by providing powerful tools for server-side rendering, static site generation, and full-stack development. It is widely used to build SEO-friendly, high-performance web applications easily.

- **Built on React** for easy development of front-end applications.
- **Provides server-side rendering (SSR)** and **static site generation (SSG)**.
- **Built-in CSS and JavaScript bundling** for better performance.
- **Highly scalable and SEO-friendly** for modern web applications.

## Getting Started with Next.js

To start with Next.js, you need to install and set it up on your machine.  
Follow these articles to install it depending on your system.

## Why learn Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over traditional React development:

- **Built-in Routing and SSR**: Unlike React, which lacks native routing, Next.js provides seamless routing functionality out of the box. Additionally, it supports server-side rendering (SSR), improving performance and SEO.
- **Faster Development**: Next.js accelerates development by offering built-in features and conventions. Developers can focus on building features rather than configuring complex setups.
- **SEO Optimization**: Next.js enhances SEO by addressing slow rendering and loading times associated with client-side rendering. Its SSR capabilities ensure that search engines can efficiently crawl and index your content.

Additionally, Next.js mitigates slow rendering and loading times inherent in client-side rendering, which is important for optimizing SEO performance.  
Its integration of server-side rendering out of the box enhances overall development efficiency and user experience.

## Features of Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that extends React’s capabilities to build server-rendered and statically generated web applications. Here are some of its key features:

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**:  
  Improves SEO and initial load performance by rendering pages on the server. Content is already available for search engines to index, and users see a fully rendered page on the first load.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**:  
  Pre-renders pages at build time, making them super fast to load. Ideal for content that changes infrequently, like blog posts or landing pages.

- **Automatic Code Splitting**:  
  Breaks down your application code into smaller bundles, improving load times by only loading the code needed for the current page.

- **Data Fetching**:  
  Offers several ways to fetch data, including `getStaticProps` for fetching at build time and `getServerSideProps` for fetching on each request.  
  This flexibility allows you to choose the most appropriate method for your specific needs.

- **Routing**:  
  Simplifies routing by automatically creating routes based on the file structure of your `pages` directory, making it easy to manage your application’s URL structure.

- **Image Optimization**:  
  Automatically optimizes images, including resizing and compressing them, for faster loading times and improved SEO.

- **Built-in CSS and JavaScript Bundling**:  
  Handles bundling and optimizing your CSS and JavaScript code, streamlining the development process.

- **API Routes**:  
  Allows you to create serverless functions directly within your application using API routes, adding backend functionality without needing a separate server.
