### Route Handlers

Route Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web Request and Response APIs.

#### Route.js Special File

Good to know: Route Handlers are only available inside the `app` directory. They are the equivalent of **API Routes** inside the `pages` directory, meaning you do not need to use API Routes and Route Handlers together.

### Convention

Route Handlers are defined in a `route.js|ts` file inside the `app` directory:

```ts
// app/api/route.ts (TypeScript Example)
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Your logic here
}
```
### Route Handlers in Next.js

Route Handlers can be nested anywhere inside the `app` directory, similar to `page.js` and `layout.js`. However, a `route.js` file cannot exist at the same route segment level as a `page.js`.

### Supported HTTP Methods

The following HTTP methods are supported:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `HEAD`
- `OPTIONS`

If an unsupported method is called, Next.js will return a `405 Method Not Allowed` response.

### Extended NextRequest and NextResponse APIs

Next.js extends the native `Request` and `Response` APIs with `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` to provide convenient helpers for advanced use cases.

### Behavior: Caching in Route Handlers

Route Handlers are not cached by default. However, you can opt into caching for `GET` methods. Other supported HTTP methods are not cached. To cache a `GET` method, use a route config option such as `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` in your Route Handler file.

#### Example: Caching a GET Method

```typescript
// app/items/route.ts

export const dynamic = 'force-static'

export async function GET() {
  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY,
    },
  })
  const data = await res.json()

  return Response.json({ data })
}
```

### Special Route Handlers

Special Route Handlers like `sitemap.ts`, `opengraph-image.tsx`, `icon.tsx`, and other metadata files remain static by default unless they use Dynamic APIs or dynamic config options.

### Route Resolution

You can consider a route the lowest-level routing primitive. They do not participate in layouts or client-side navigations like pages.

There cannot be a `route.js` file at the same route as `page.js`.

### Example

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}

// app/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {}
```
