### Parallel Routes

**Parallel Routes** allows you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages within the same layout. They are useful for highly dynamic sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites.

For example, considering a dashboard, you can use parallel routes to simultaneously render the team and analytics pages:

### Slots

Parallel routes are created using **named slots**. Slots are defined with the `@folder` convention. For example, the following file structure defines two slots: `@analytics` and `@team`.

Slots are passed as props to the shared parent layout. For the example above, the component in `app/layout.js` now accepts the `@analytics` and `@team` slots props, and can render them in parallel alongside the `children` prop.

However, slots are **not route segments** and do not affect the URL structure. For example, for `/@analytics/views`, the URL will be `/views` since `@analytics` is a slot. Slots are combined with the regular **Page** component to form the final page associated with the route segment.

Because of this, you cannot have separate static and dynamic slots at the same route segment level. If one slot is dynamic, all slots at that level must be dynamic.

### Conditional Rendering with Parallel Routes

```tsx
import { checkUserRole } from '@/lib/auth'

export default function Layout({
  user,
  admin,
}: {
  user: React.ReactNode
  admin: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const role = checkUserRole()
  return role === 'admin' ? admin : user
}
```
