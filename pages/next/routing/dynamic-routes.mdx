### Dynamic Routes

When you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use **Dynamic Segments** that are filled in at request time or prerendered at build time.

#### Convention

A **Dynamic Segment** can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: `[folderName]`. For example: `[id]` or `[slug]`.

Dynamic Segments are passed as the `params` prop to layout, page, route, and `generateMetadata` functions.

### Example

For example, a blog could include the following route: `app/blog/[slug]/page.js`, where `[slug]` is the **Dynamic Segment** for blog posts.

#### `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (TypeScript)

```tsx
export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  return <div>My Post: {slug}</div>
}
```

### Good to Know

Since the `params` prop is a promise, you must use `async/await` or React's `use` function to access the values.

In version 14 and earlier, `params` was a synchronous prop. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be **deprecated** in the future.

Dynamic Segments are equivalent to **Dynamic Routes** in the `pages` directory.

### Generating Static Params

The `generateStaticParams` function can be used in combination with dynamic route segments to statically generate routes at build time instead of on-demand at request time.
### Example of `generateStaticParams`

```ts
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())
 
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))
}
    ```

    ### The Primary Benefit of `generateStaticParams`

The primary benefit of the `generateStaticParams` function is its smart retrieval of data. If content is fetched within the `generateStaticParams` function using a fetch request, the requests are automatically **memoized**. This means a fetch request with the same arguments across multiple `generateStaticParams`, Layouts, and Pages will only be made once, which decreases build times.

### Migration

Use the **migration guide** if you are migrating from the `pages` directory.

For more information and advanced use cases, see the **`generateStaticParams`** server function documentation.
### Catch-all Segments

Dynamic Segments can be extended to **catch-all** subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets: `[...folderName]`.

For example, `app/shop/[...slug]/page.js` will match `/shop/clothes`, but also `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`, and so on.

---

### Optional Catch-all Segments

Catch-all Segments can be made **optional** by including the parameter in double square brackets: `[[...folderName]]`.

For example, `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` will also match `/shop`, in addition to `/shop/clothes`, `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`.

The difference between catch-all and optional catch-all segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (e.g., `/shop` in the example above).
