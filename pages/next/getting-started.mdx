### Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is an open-source React framework for building full-stack web applications (created and maintained by Vercel).  
You can use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations. It is built on top of **Server Components**, which allows you to render server-rendered React components to the client. This means your pages can be more interactive and dynamic, while still being fast and performant.

One of its notable features is the **Next.js App Router**, which facilitates routing within your application.  
This article will dive into the Next.js App Router, its components, and implementation, and provide a code example and a brief output.


### Create Your First Next.js App

To create a Next.js app, you can use the following steps:

---

#### Step 1: Install Node.js

If you haven't already installed **Node.js**, open a terminal and run the following command to create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
```

#### Step 2: On Installation, You'll See the Following Prompts:

- **What is your project named?** `my-next-app`
- **Would you like to use TypeScript?** `No / Yes`
- **Would you like to use ESLint?** `No / Yes`
- **Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?** `No / Yes`
- **Would you like to use `src/` directory?** `No / Yes`
- **Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)** `No / Yes`
- **Would you like to customize the default import alias (`@/*`)?** `No / Yes`
- **What import alias would you like configured?** `@/*`

#### Step 3: Navigate Into Your Newly Created App Directory

```bash
cd my-next-app
```

#### Step 4: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Step 5: Open Your Browser

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your Next.js app running.

### Next.js Scripts

Next.js provides several scripts to manage your application:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "export": "next export",
  "lint": "next lint"
}
```
