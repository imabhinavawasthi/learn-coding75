# OSI Model | 7 Layers Explained in Computer Network

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model is a reference framework that describes how data from a software application in one computer travels through a network medium to reach a software application in another computer. The OSI model consists of seven layers, each of which performs specific functions to facilitate network communication. 

The OSI model was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** in 1984, and it is considered an architectural model for inter-computer communications.

### Characteristics of OSI Model

The OSI model is divided into two layers:

1. **Upper layers**: These layers deal with application-related tasks and are implemented primarily in software. The **Application layer** is closest to the end-user, interacting directly with software applications.
2. **Lower layers**: These layers manage data transport tasks, and the **Physical layer** is the lowest, closest to the physical medium used for transmission.

## 1 Physical Layer

The **Physical Layer** is the lowest layer in the OSI model. Its main function is to transmit raw bits over a physical medium.

### Functions of the Physical Layer:
- **Line Configuration**: Defines how devices are physically connected.
- **Data Transmission**: Specifies the transmission mode (simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex).
- **Topology**: Determines the arrangement of network devices.
- **Signals**: Defines the type of signal used for transmitting data.

## 2 Data-Link Layer

The **Data-Link Layer** ensures error-free transfer of data frames across the network.

### Functions of the Data-Link Layer:
- **Framing**: Converts the raw bit stream into frames and adds necessary headers and trailers.
- **Physical Addressing**: Adds destination and source addresses to frames.
- **Flow Control**: Regulates the data transfer rate to prevent data corruption.
- **Error Control**: Adds error-checking data (e.g., CRC) to ensure data integrity.
- **Access Control**: Determines which device can access the shared communication channel at any time.

### Sub-Layers:
- **Logical Link Control (LLC)**: Provides flow control and error management, and defines the upper boundary of the data link layer.
- **Media Access Control (MAC)**: Controls how devices on the network gain access to the transmission medium.

## 3 Network Layer

The **Network Layer** is responsible for device addressing and routing, ensuring that data is sent from the source to the destination across multiple networks.

### Functions of the Network Layer:
- **Internetworking**: Provides logical connections between devices across networks.
- **Addressing**: Adds source and destination addresses to packets.
- **Routing**: Determines the best path for data to travel from source to destination.
- **Packetizing**: Breaks down data into packets for transmission.

## 4 Transport Layer

The **Transport Layer** is responsible for end-to-end communication between devices. It ensures that data is delivered in sequence and without errors.

### Functions of the Transport Layer:
- **Service-point Addressing**: Identifies the destination process using port addresses.
- **Segmentation and Reassembly**: Divides data into segments and reassembles them at the destination.
- **Connection Control**: Provides both connection-oriented and connectionless services.
- **Flow Control**: Ensures smooth data transmission without congestion.
- **Error Control**: Detects and corrects errors in the data stream.

### Protocols:
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: A reliable, connection-oriented protocol.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: An unreliable, connectionless protocol.

## 5 Session Layer

The **Session Layer** is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions between devices.

### Functions of the Session Layer:
- **Dialog Control**: Manages communication in full-duplex or half-duplex modes.
- **Synchronization**: Adds checkpoints to data to allow for recovery if transmission errors occur.

## 6 Presentation Layer

The **Presentation Layer** is responsible for translating, encrypting, and compressing data to ensure compatibility between different systems.

### Functions of the Presentation Layer:
- **Translation**: Converts data between different encoding schemes.
- **Encryption**: Ensures data privacy by transforming the data into a secure format.
- **Compression**: Reduces the size of data to optimize bandwidth.

---

## 7 Application Layer

The **Application Layer** is closest to the end-user and facilitates access to network services.

### Functions of the Application Layer:
- **File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM)**: Allows users to access, retrieve, and manage files on remote systems.
- **Mail Services**: Manages email forwarding, storage, and retrieval.
- **Directory Services**: Provides global information about various network objects.

This breakdown of the OSI model helps in understanding how data is transmitted across networks, with each layer serving a specific function to ensure reliable communication.
