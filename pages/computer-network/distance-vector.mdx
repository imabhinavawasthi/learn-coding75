## Distance Vector Routing Algorithm

The **Distance Vector algorithm** is **iterative**, **asynchronous**, and **distributed**.

- **Distributed**: Each node receives information from its directly attached neighbors, calculates, and shares the result back.
- **Iterative**: The process continues until no more new information needs to be exchanged.
- **Asynchronous**: Nodes don't need to operate in sync with each other.

The Distance Vector algorithm is a **dynamic** algorithm, used in networks like ARPANET and RIP.

### Key Concepts of Distance Vector Routing:
1. **Knowledge about the whole network**: Each router shares its knowledge with the entire network.
2. **Routing only to neighbors**: Routers send their knowledge only to directly connected routers.
3. **Information sharing at regular intervals**: Routers share their updated information every 30 seconds with neighbors.
