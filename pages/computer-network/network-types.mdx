# Computer Network Types

A computer network is a group of computers linked together to enable communication and resource sharing, such as data, applications, and devices. Based on their size, computer networks are categorized into the following types:

## Types of Computer Networks

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

## LAN (Local Area Network)

A **Local Area Network (LAN)** is a network of computers connected within a small geographical area such as a building or an office.

### Features of LAN:
- It connects two or more personal computers through communication mediums like twisted pair or coaxial cables.
- LAN is less costly, as it uses inexpensive hardware like hubs, network adapters, and Ethernet cables.
- It offers extremely fast data transfer rates.
- LAN provides higher security compared to other network types.

## PAN (Personal Area Network)

A **Personal Area Network (PAN)** is a small network designed for individual use, typically within a range of 10 meters.

### Features of PAN:
- PAN is used to connect personal devices like laptops, mobile phones, media players, and game consoles.
- It covers an area of around 30 feet (10 meters).
- Thomas Zimmerman is credited with bringing the concept of PAN into existence.

### Types of PAN:
1. **Wired Personal Area Network**: This is created using USB connections.
2. **Wireless Personal Area Network**: This is developed using wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

### Examples of PAN:
- **Body Area Network (BAN)**: A network that moves with the person (e.g., a mobile network carried by an individual).
- **Offline Network**: A home network connecting devices like printers, computers, and TVs, not connected to the internet.
- **Small Home Office Network**: Connecting devices to the internet and corporate network via a VPN.

## MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** spans a larger geographic area by interconnecting multiple LANs. It is commonly used in cities and connects various government agencies, businesses, and private industries.

### Features of MAN:
- It uses telephone lines to connect various LANs.
- It has a larger range than LANs, typically covering a city or a large campus.
- Common protocols include RS-232, Frame Relay, and ADSL.

### Uses of MAN:
- Communication between city banks.
- Airline reservation systems.
- College networks within a city.
- Military communication systems.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** spans a large geographical area, such as states, countries, or even continents. The internet is one of the largest examples of WAN.

### Features of WAN:
- WAN is larger than LAN and extends over vast distances using various communication technologies such as telephone lines, fiber-optic cables, or satellite links.
- It is widely used in business, government, and education sectors.

### Examples of WAN:
- **Mobile Broadband**: A 4G network used across large regions or countries.
- **Last Mile**: A telecom company providing internet services to customers via fiber connections.
- **Private Network**: A bank connecting multiple offices through a leased telephone line.

### Advantages of WAN:
- **Geographical Coverage**: WAN connects offices or branches located in different cities or countries.
- **Centralized Data**: Data is stored centrally, eliminating the need for multiple backup servers.
- **Fast Communication**: It enables the fast exchange of messages and data sharing across the globe.
- **Global Business**: WAN enables businesses to operate and share resources globally.
- **High Bandwidth**: Leased lines provide high bandwidth, increasing data transfer rates and improving business productivity.

### Disadvantages of WAN:
- **Security Issues**: WAN has more security risks than LAN or MAN, as it combines multiple technologies, increasing vulnerability.
- **Requires Firewall & Antivirus**: Data transferred over WAN is susceptible to hacking or virus injection, so robust security systems are necessary.
- **High Setup Cost**: The installation of WAN networks is costly due to the need for specialized hardware like routers and switches.
- **Troubleshooting Problems**: With a large geographical coverage, diagnosing and fixing issues can be difficult.
