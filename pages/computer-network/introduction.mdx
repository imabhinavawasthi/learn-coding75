# What is Computer Network?

A **computer network** is a set of devices connected through links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receiving data. The links connecting the nodes are known as **communication channels**.

A Computer Network uses **distributed processing**, in which tasks are divided among several computers. Instead of a single computer handling an entire task, each separate computer handles a subset. This aligns with the correct understanding of distributed processing, where multiple computers work on different parts of a task.

## Advantages of Distributed Processing

- **Security**: It provides limited interaction that a user can have with the entire system.  
  _Example_: A bank allows users to access their own accounts through an ATM without allowing them to access the bank's entire database.

- **Faster Problem Solving**: Multiple computers can solve a problem faster than a single machine working alone.

- **Security Through Redundancy**: Multiple computers running the same program simultaneously can provide security through redundancy.  
  _Example_: If four computers run the same program and one computer experiences a hardware error, the other computers can override it.
