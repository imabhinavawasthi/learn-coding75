## Client/Server Network

A **Client/Server network** is a network model designed for end users (clients) to access resources such as songs, videos, etc., from a **central computer** known as a **server**.

- The central controller is called the **server**, and all other computers connected to it are called **clients**.
- The **server handles major operations** such as security, network management, and resource management.
- It manages all shared resources like files, directories, printers, etc.
- Clients communicate **through the server**.  
  For example:  
  If *Client 1* wants to send data to *Client 2*, it must first request permission from the server.  
  Once approved, the server facilitates the communication between the clients.
