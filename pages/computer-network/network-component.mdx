## Computer Network Components

Computer network components are the major parts required to install and run a network. Some essential components include **NIC**, **switch**, **cable**, **hub**, **router**, and **modem**. Depending on the type of network (wired or wireless), some components may or may not be necessary. For example, a wireless network does not require cables.

### 1. NIC (Network Interface Card)

- NIC is a hardware component used to connect a computer to a network.
- It supports transfer rates of 10, 100, or 1000 Mb/s.
- The **MAC address** or **physical address** is encoded on the chip and uniquely identifies the NIC.
- The MAC address is stored in **PROM** (Programmable Read-Only Memory).

#### Types of NIC:

- **Wired NIC**: Integrated into the motherboard and uses cables and connectors for data transmission.
- **Wireless NIC**: Uses antennas to connect over wireless networks. Commonly found in laptops.

### 2. Hub

- A **Hub** is a hardware device that splits the network connection among multiple devices.
- When a request is made by a computer, the hub **broadcasts** it to the entire network.
- All devices check if the request is meant for them; if not, they ignore it.
- Hubs consume more bandwidth and limit communication efficiency.
- Modern networks typically **replace hubs with switches or routers**.

### 3. Switch

- A **Switch** connects multiple devices in a network and is more intelligent than a hub.
- It maintains a table to identify where data should be sent.
- It **forwards messages only to the intended recipient**, improving network speed.
- Switches provide a direct path between source and destination, increasing overall performance.

### 4. Router

- A **Router** connects a local network (LAN) to the internet.
- Operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model.
- Analyzes incoming packets and forwards them based on the routing table.
- Determines the best path for data transmission.

#### Advantages of Router:

- **Security**: Only the addressed device receives and reads the data.
- **Reliability**: Network outages in one area do not affect others served by different routers.
- **Performance**: Divides traffic efficiently across smaller segments, reducing congestion.

### 5. Modem

- A **Modem** allows computers to connect to the internet via telephone lines.
- Installed in the **PCI slot** on the motherboard.
- **Modem = Modulator/Demodulator**: Converts digital data to analog for transmission and vice versa.

#### Types of Modems:

- Standard PC Modem (Dial-up)
- Cellular Modem
- Cable Modem

### 6. Cables and Connectors

Cables are used as transmission media for data transfer.

#### Types of Cables:

- **Twisted Pair Cable**
- **Coaxial Cable**
- **Fibre-Optic Cable**
