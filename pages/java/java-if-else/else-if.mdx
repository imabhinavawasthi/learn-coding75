## Java Else If

### The else if Statement

Use the `else if` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

#### Syntax

```java
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```

#### Example

```java
int time = 22;
if (time < 10) {
  System.out.println("Good morning.");
} else if (time < 18) {
  System.out.println("Good day.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Good evening.");
}
```

// Outputs "Good evening."

### Example explained

In the example above, `time` (22) is greater than 10, so the first condition is false. The next condition, in the `else if` statement, is also false, so we move on to the `else` condition since `condition1` and `condition2` are both false - and print to the screen **"Good evening"**.

However, if the time was `14`, our program would print **"Good day."**.
