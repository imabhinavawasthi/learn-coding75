## Java If ... Else

### Java Conditions and If Statements

You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- **Less than:** `a < b`
- **Less than or equal to:** `a <= b`
- **Greater than:** `a > b`
- **Greater than or equal to:** `a >= b`
- **Equal to:** `a == b`
- **Not Equal to:** `a != b`

You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

Java has the following conditional statements:

- Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
- Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
- Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
- Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

### The if Statement

Use the `if` statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.

#### Syntax

```java
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

> **Note:** `if` is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (`If` or `IF`) will generate an error.

#### Example

In the example below, we test two values to find out if `20` is greater than `18`. If the condition is true, print some text:

```java
if (20 > 18) {
  System.out.println("20 is greater than 18");
}
```

We can also test variables:

```java
int x = 20;
int y = 18;
if (x > y) {
  System.out.println("x is greater than y");
}
```

### Example explained

In the example above, we use two variables, `x` and `y`, to test whether `x` is greater than `y` (using the `>` operator). Since `x` is `20` and `y` is `18`, and we know that `20` is greater than `18`, we print to the screen that **"x is greater than y"**.
