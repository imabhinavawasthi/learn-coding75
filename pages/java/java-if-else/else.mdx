## Java Else

### The else Statement

Use the `else` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

#### Syntax

```java
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

#### Example

```java
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
  System.out.println("Good day.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Good evening.");
}
```

// Outputs "Good evening."

### Example explained

In the example above, `time` (20) is greater than 18, so the condition is false. Because of this, we move on to the `else` condition and print to the screen **"Good evening"**. If the time was less than 18, the program would print **"Good day"**.
