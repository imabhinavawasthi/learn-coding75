# Java Syntax

In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called `Main.java`, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:

```java
// Main.java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

## Example Explained

Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. The class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class `Main`.

> **Note:** Java is case-sensitive: `MyClass` and `myclass` have different meanings.

The name of the Java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add `.java` to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, ensure that Java is properly installed. Refer to the *Get Started* chapter for installation instructions. The output should be:

```shell
Hello World
```

## The `main` Method

The `main()` method is required and appears in every Java program:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

Any code inside the `main()` method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after itâ€”you will learn them gradually.

For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name that must match the filename, and every program must contain the `main()` method.

## `System.out.println()`

Inside the `main()` method, we can use the `println()` method to print a line of text to the screen:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

> **Note:** The curly braces `{}` mark the beginning and the end of a block of code.

`System` is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as `out`, which stands for "output". The `println()` method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

Don't worry too much about how `System`, `out`, and `println()` work. Just know that you need them together to print output to the screen.

You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (`;`).
