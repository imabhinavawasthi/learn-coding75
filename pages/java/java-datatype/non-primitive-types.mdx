# Java Non-Primitive Data Types

## Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

- Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for `String`).
- Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
- Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like `int`), while non-primitive types typically start with an uppercase letter (like `String`).
- Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be `null`.

Examples of non-primitive types are `Strings`, `Arrays`, `Classes`, etc. You will learn more about these in a later chapter.
