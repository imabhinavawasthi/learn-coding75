# Java Characters

## Characters

The `char` data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like `'A'` or `'c'`:

```java
char myGrade = 'B';
System.out.println(myGrade);
```

Alternatively, if you are familiar with ASCII values, you can use those to display certain characters:

```java
char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
System.out.println(myVar1);
System.out.println(myVar2);
System.out.println(myVar3);
```

Tip: A list of all ASCII values can be found in our ASCII Table Reference.

## Strings

The `String` data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes:

```java
String greeting = "Hello World";
System.out.println(greeting);
```
