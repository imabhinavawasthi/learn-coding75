# Java Numbers

## Numbers

Primitive number types are divided into two groups:

- **Integer types** store whole numbers, positive or negative (such as `123` or `-456`), without decimals. Valid types are `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long`. Which type you should use depends on the numeric value.
- **Floating point types** represent numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: `float` and `double`.

Even though there are many numeric types in Java, the most used for numbers are `int` (for whole numbers) and `double` (for floating point numbers). However, we will describe them all as you continue to read.

## Integer Types

### Byte
The `byte` data type can store whole numbers from `-128` to `127`. This can be used instead of `int` or other integer types to save memory when you are certain that the value will be within `-128` and `127`:

```java
byte myNum = 100;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

### Short
The `short` data type can store whole numbers from `-32,768` to `32,767`:

```java
short myNum = 5000;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

### Int
The `int` data type can store whole numbers from `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`. In general, and in our tutorial, the `int` data type is the preferred data type when we create variables with a numeric value.

```java
int myNum = 100000;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

### Long
The `long` data type can store whole numbers from `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808` to `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`. This is used when `int` is not large enough to store the value. Note that you should end the value with an "L":

```java
long myNum = 15000000000L;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

## Floating Point Types

You should use a floating point type whenever you need a number with a decimal, such as `9.99` or `3.14515`.

The `float` and `double` data types can store fractional numbers. Note that you should end the value with an "f" for floats and "d" for doubles:

### Float Example

```java
float myNum = 5.75f;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

### Double Example

```java
double myNum = 19.99d;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

## Use `float` or `double`?

The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of `float` is only six or seven decimal digits, while `double` variables have a precision of about 16 digits. Therefore, it is safer to use `double` for most calculations.

## Scientific Numbers

A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of `10`:

```java
float f1 = 35e3f;
double d1 = 12E4d;
System.out.println(f1);
System.out.println(d1);
```
