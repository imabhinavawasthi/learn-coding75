## Difference Between `throw` and `throws` in Java

The `throw` and `throws` are concepts of exception handling where the `throw` keyword explicitly throws an exception from a method or block of code, whereas the `throws` keyword is used in the method signature to declare possible exceptions.

There are several differences between `throw` and `throws` keywords, as shown in the table below:

| Sr. No. | Basis of Differences | `throw` | `throws` |
|---------|----------------------|---------|---------|
| 1. | Definition | Used to throw an exception explicitly in the code inside a function or block | Used in the method signature to declare exceptions that might be thrown by the function |
| 2. | Uses | Can only propagate unchecked exceptions (checked exceptions cannot be propagated using `throw` alone) | Can declare both checked and unchecked exceptions (but is primarily used for checked exceptions) |
| 3. | Syntax | Followed by an instance of an exception to be thrown | Followed by exception class names |
| 4. | Declaration | Used within a method | Used with the method signature |
| 5. | Internal Implementation | Can throw only one exception at a time | Can declare multiple exceptions that a method might throw |

## Java `throw` Keyword
The `throw` keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception. It disrupts the normal program flow by transferring control to the nearest `catch` block that can handle the exception.

### Java `throw` Example

```java
public class TestThrow {  
    public static void checkNum(int num) {  
        if (num < 1) {  
            throw new ArithmeticException("\nNumber is negative, cannot calculate square");  
        }  
        else {  
            System.out.println("Square of " + num + " is " + (num*num));  
        }  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        TestThrow obj = new TestThrow();  
        obj.checkNum(-3);  
        System.out.println("Rest of the code..");  
    }  
}  
```

### Explanation
- The `checkNum()` method checks if the number is negative.
- If the number is negative, an `ArithmeticException` is explicitly thrown.
- Since the exception is not caught, the program terminates before executing further statements.

## Java `throws` Keyword
The `throws` clause is used in method signatures to indicate that the method may throw certain types of exceptions.

### Java `throws` Example

```java
public class TestThrows {  
    public static int divideNum(int m, int n) throws ArithmeticException {  
        int div = m / n;  
        return div;  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        TestThrows obj = new TestThrows();  
        try {  
            System.out.println(obj.divideNum(45, 0));  
        }  
        catch (ArithmeticException e){  
            System.out.println("\nNumber cannot be divided by 0");  
        }  
        System.out.println("Rest of the code..");  
    }  
}  
```

### Explanation
- The `divideNum()` method includes `throws ArithmeticException` in its signature.
- If division by zero occurs, the exception is caught in the `catch` block.
- The program execution continues after handling the exception.

## Java `throw` and `throws` Example

```java
public class TestThrowAndThrows {  
    static void method() throws ArithmeticException {  
        System.out.println("Inside the method()");  
        throw new ArithmeticException("throwing ArithmeticException");  
    }  
    public static void main(String args[]) {  
        try {  
            method();  
        }  
        catch(ArithmeticException e) {  
            System.out.println("Caught in main() method");  
        }  
    }  
}  
```

### Explanation
- `method()` explicitly throws an `ArithmeticException`.
- The exception is caught in the `main()` method using a `try-catch` block.

## Conclusion
Understanding the distinction between `throw` and `throws` in Java is crucial for effective exception handling.

- `throw` is used to explicitly throw exceptions within a method.
- `throws` is used in method signatures to declare potential exceptions.

By mastering these concepts, Java developers can implement precise exception handling strategies to enhance code robustness.
