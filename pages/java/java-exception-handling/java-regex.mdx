## What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

A regular expression can be a single character or a more complicated pattern.

Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

Java does not have a built-in Regular Expression class, but we can import the `java.util.regex` package to work with regular expressions. The package includes the following classes:

- **Pattern Class** - Defines a pattern (to be used in a search)
- **Matcher Class** - Used to search for the pattern
- **PatternSyntaxException Class** - Indicates a syntax error in a regular expression pattern

## Example

Find out if there are any occurrences of the word "Coding75" in a sentence:

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("Coding75", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("Visit Coding75!");
    boolean matchFound = matcher.find();
    if(matchFound) {
      System.out.println("Match found");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Match not found");
    }
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Match found
```

## Example Explained

- The word "Coding75" is being searched for in a sentence.
- The `Pattern.compile()` method is used to create the pattern.
  - The first parameter specifies the pattern to search for.
  - The second parameter (`Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE`) makes the search case-insensitive (optional).
- The `matcher()` method searches for the pattern in the string and returns a `Matcher` object.
- The `find()` method returns `true` if the pattern is found; otherwise, it returns `false`.

## Flags

Flags in the `compile()` method change how the search is performed:

- **`Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE`** - Ignores letter case when searching.
- **`Pattern.LITERAL`** - Treats special characters as ordinary characters.
- **`Pattern.UNICODE_CASE`** - Used with `CASE_INSENSITIVE` to ignore case in Unicode characters.

## Regular Expression Patterns

The first parameter of the `Pattern.compile()` method is the pattern, which defines what to search for.

### Brackets

Brackets are used to find a range of characters:

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `[abc]` | Find one character from the options between the brackets |
| `[^abc]` | Find one character NOT between the brackets |
| `[0-9]` | Find one character from the range 0 to 9 |

### Metacharacters

Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

| Metacharacter | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `|` | Find a match for any one of the patterns separated by `|` (e.g., `cat|dog|fish`) |
| `.` | Find just one instance of any character |
| `^` | Matches at the beginning of a string (e.g., `^Hello`) |
| `$` | Matches at the end of a string (e.g., `World$`) |
| `\d` | Find a digit |
| `\s` | Find a whitespace character |
| `\b` | Find a match at the beginning or end of a word (e.g., `\bWORD` or `WORD\b`) |
| `\uxxxx` | Find the Unicode character specified by `xxxx` |

## Quantifiers

Quantifiers define quantities:

| Quantifier | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `n+` | Matches any string that contains at least one `n` |
| `n*` | Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of `n` |
| `n?` | Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrence of `n` |
| `n{x}` | Matches any string that contains exactly `x` occurrences of `n` |
| `n{x,y}` | Matches any string that contains between `x` and `y` occurrences of `n` |
| `n{x,}` | Matches any string that contains at least `x` occurrences of `n` |
