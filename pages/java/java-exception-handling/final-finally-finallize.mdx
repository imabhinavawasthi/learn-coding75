## Difference Between final, finally, and finalize

| Feature | final | finally | finalize |
|---------|-------|---------|----------|
| Definition | An access modifier used to restrict class, method, or variable | A block that executes important code whether an exception occurs or not | A method used to clean up resources before garbage collection |
| Applicable To | Classes, methods, and variables | Try-catch block | Objects |
| Functionality | Prevents modification, inheritance, or overriding | Ensures execution of important code | Performs cleanup before object destruction |
| Execution | Executed when called | Always executed after try-catch | Executed before garbage collection |

### Example of final:
```java
public class FinalExample {
    final int age = 18;
    void display() {
        age = 55; // Compile-time error
    }
}
```

### Example of finally:
```java
try {
    int data = 25 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception handled");
} finally {
    System.out.println("finally block always executes");
}
```

### Example of finalize:
```java
protected void finalize() {
    System.out.println("Called finalize method");
}
```
