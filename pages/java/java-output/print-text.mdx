## Java Output / Print

### Print Text

You learned from the previous chapter that you can use the `println()` method to output values or print text in Java:

```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

You can add as many `println()` methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method:

```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
System.out.println("It is awesome!");
```

### Double Quotes

Text must be wrapped inside double quotation marks `""`.

If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:

```java
System.out.println("This sentence will work!");
System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);
```

### The `print()` Method

There is also a `print()` method, which is similar to `println()`.

The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

```java
System.out.print("Hello World! ");
System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");
```

Note that we add an extra space (after `"Hello World! "` in the example above) for better readability.

In this tutorial, we will only use `println()` as it makes the code output easier to read.
