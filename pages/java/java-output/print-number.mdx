## Java Output Numbers

### Print Numbers

You can also use the `println()` method to print numbers.

However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:

```java
System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(358);
System.out.println(50000);
```

You can also perform mathematical calculations inside the `println()` method:

```java
System.out.println(3 + 3);
```

```java
System.out.println(2 * 5);
```
