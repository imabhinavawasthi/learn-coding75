## Java Multi-Dimensional Arrays

### Multidimensional Arrays
A multidimensional array is an array of arrays.

Multidimensional arrays are useful when you want to store data in a tabular form, like a table with rows and columns.

To create a two-dimensional array, add each array within its own set of curly braces:

```java
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
```

`myNumbers` is now an array with two arrays as its elements.

### Access Elements
To access the elements of the `myNumbers` array, specify two indexes: one for the array, and one for the element inside that array. This example accesses the third element (`7`) in the second array (`1`) of `myNumbers`:

```java
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
System.out.println(myNumbers[1][2]); // Outputs 7
```

Remember: Array indexes start with `0`: `[0]` is the first element, `[1]` is the second element, etc.

### Change Element Values
You can also change the value of an element:

```java
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
myNumbers[1][2] = 9;
System.out.println(myNumbers[1][2]); // Outputs 9 instead of 7
```

### Loop Through a Multi-Dimensional Array
You can also use a `for` loop inside another `for` loop to get the elements of a two-dimensional array:

```java
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
for (int i = 0; i < myNumbers.length; ++i) {
  for (int j = 0; j < myNumbers[i].length; ++j) {
    System.out.println(myNumbers[i][j]);
  }
}
```

Or you could use a `for-each` loop, which is considered easier to read and write:

```java
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
for (int[] row : myNumbers) {
  for (int i : row) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```
