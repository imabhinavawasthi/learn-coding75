## Java Methods

### Creating a Method
A method is a block of code that runs when called. Methods help reuse code efficiently.

```java
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }
}
```

### Calling a Method
To call a method, use its name followed by parentheses:

```java
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}
```

#### Output:
```
I just got executed!
```

### Calling a Method Multiple Times
```java
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
  }
}
```
#### Output:
```
I just got executed!
I just got executed!
I just got executed!
```

Methods make code reusable and more organized, reducing redundancy.
