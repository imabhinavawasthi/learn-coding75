## Java Method Parameters

### Parameters and Arguments
Information can be passed to methods as a parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the method.

Parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.

The following example has a method that takes a `String` called `fname` as a parameter. When the method is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the method to print the full name:

### Example
```java
public class Main {
  static void myMethod(String fname) {
    System.out.println(fname + " Refsnes");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod("Liam");
    myMethod("Jenny");
    myMethod("Anja");
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Liam Refsnes
Jenny Refsnes
Anja Refsnes
```

When a parameter is passed to the method, it is called an argument. So, from the example above: `fname` is a parameter, while `Liam`, `Jenny`, and `Anja` are arguments.

### Multiple Parameters
You can have as many parameters as you like:

### Example
```java
public class Main {
  static void myMethod(String fname, int age) {
    System.out.println(fname + " is " + age);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod("Liam", 5);
    myMethod("Jenny", 8);
    myMethod("Anja", 31);
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Liam is 5
Jenny is 8
Anja is 31
```

Note that when you are working with multiple parameters, the method call must have the same number of arguments as there are parameters, and the arguments must be passed in the same order.

### A Method with If...Else
It is common to use `if...else` statements inside methods:

### Example
```java
public class Main {

  // Create a checkAge() method with an integer variable called age
  static void checkAge(int age) {

    // If age is less than 18, print "access denied"
    if (age < 18) {
      System.out.println("Access denied - You are not old enough!");

    // If age is greater than, or equal to, 18, print "access granted"
    } else {
      System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!");
    }

  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    checkAge(20); // Call the checkAge method and pass along an age of 20
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Access granted - You are old enough!
