## Java Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

- **String** - stores text, such as `"Hello"`. String values are surrounded by double quotes.
- **int** - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as `123` or `-123`.
- **float** - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as `19.99` or `-19.99`.
- **char** - stores single characters, such as `'a'` or `'B'`. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.
- **boolean** - stores values with two states: `true` or `false`.

## Declaring (Creating) Variables

To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:

```java
// Syntax
type variableName = value;
```

Where `type` is one of Java's types (such as `int` or `String`), and `variableName` is the name of the variable (such as `x` or `name`). The equal sign `=` is used to assign values to the variable.

### Example 1: Creating a String Variable
Create a variable called `name` of type `String` and assign it the value `"John"`. Then, we use `println()` to print the `name` variable:

```java
String name = "John";
System.out.println(name);
```

### Example 2: Creating an Integer Variable
Create a variable called `myNum` of type `int` and assign it the value `15`:

```java
int myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

### Example 3: Declaring a Variable Without Assigning a Value
You can also declare a variable without assigning a value initially and assign the value later:

```java
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

### Example 4: Overwriting a Variable's Value
If you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:

```java
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20
System.out.println(myNum);
```

## Final Variables

If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the `final` keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

```java
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // This will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
