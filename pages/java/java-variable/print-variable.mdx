## Java Print Variables

### Display Variables
The `println()` method is often used to display variables.

To combine both text and a variable, use the `+` character:

```java
String name = "John";
System.out.println("Hello " + name);
```

You can also use the `+` character to add a variable to another variable:

```java
String firstName = "John ";
String lastName = "Doe";
String fullName = firstName + lastName;
System.out.println(fullName);
```

For numeric values, the `+` character works as a mathematical operator (notice that we use `int` (integer) variables here):

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
System.out.println(x + y); // Print the value of x + y
```

From the example above, you can expect:

- `x` stores the value `5`
- `y` stores the value `6`
- Then we use the `println()` method to display the value of `x + y`, which is `11`.
