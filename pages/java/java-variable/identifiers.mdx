## Java Identifiers

### Identifiers
All Java variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called **identifiers**.

Identifiers can be short names (like `x` and `y`) or more descriptive names (`age`, `sum`, `totalVolume`).

**Note:** It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

```java
// Good
int minutesPerHour = 60;

// OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
int m = 60;
```

### Rules for Naming Variables
- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names should start with a lowercase letter and cannot contain whitespace.
- Names can also begin with `$` and `_`.
- Names are case-sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are different variables).
- Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as `int` or `boolean`) cannot be used as names.
