# Immutable String in Java

A `String` is an unavoidable type of variable while writing any application program. String references are used to store various attributes like username, password, etc. In Java, `String` objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.

Once a `String` object is created, its data or state can't be changed, but a new `String` object is created.

## Example: Understanding Immutability

### `Testimmutablestring.java`

```java
class Testimmutablestring {  
 public static void main(String args[]) {  
   String s = "Sachin";  
   s.concat(" Tendulkar"); // concat() method appends the string at the end  
   System.out.println(s); // will print Sachin because strings are immutable objects  
 }  
}
```

### Output:

```
Sachin
```

Now it can be understood by the diagram given below. Here `Sachin` is not changed, but a new object is created with `Sachin Tendulkar`. That is why `String` is known as immutable.

## Assigning New Reference

As seen in the example above, two objects are created, but the `s` reference variable still refers to "Sachin", not "Sachin Tendulkar".

However, if we explicitly assign it to the reference variable, it will refer to "Sachin Tendulkar".

### `Testimmutablestring1.java`

```java
class Testimmutablestring1 {  
 public static void main(String args[]) {  
   String s = "Sachin";  
   s = s.concat(" Tendulkar");  
   System.out.println(s);  
 }  
}
```

### Output:

```
Sachin Tendulkar
```

In this case, `s` points to "Sachin Tendulkar". Please note that the `Sachin` object is still not modified.

## Why String Objects Are Immutable in Java?

Java uses the concept of String literal. Suppose there are 5 reference variables, all referring to one object "Sachin". If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will affect all reference variables. That is why `String` objects are immutable in Java.

### Features Making `String` Objects Immutable:

#### 1. ClassLoader:

A `ClassLoader` in Java uses a `String` object as an argument. If the `String` object were modifiable, its value might change, causing the class that is supposed to be loaded to be different. To avoid this misinterpretation, `String` is immutable.

#### 2. Thread Safety:

As `String` objects are immutable, we don't have to handle synchronization when sharing an object across multiple threads.

#### 3. Security:

Immutable `String` objects prevent unauthorized modifications, making applications more secure. For example, in banking software, the username and password cannot be modified by an intruder because `String` objects are immutable.

#### 4. Efficient Heap Space Usage:

The immutability of `String` minimizes memory usage in the heap. When declaring a new `String` object, the JVM checks whether the value already exists in the String pool. If it does, the same value is assigned to the new object, optimizing heap space utilization.

## Why Is `String` Class Final in Java?

The `String` class is declared `final` to prevent overriding its methods. This ensures that new `String` objects retain the same behavior and features as existing ones.
