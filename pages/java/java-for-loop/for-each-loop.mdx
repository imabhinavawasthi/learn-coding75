## Java For-Each Loop

### For-Each Loop

There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array (or other data sets):

### Syntax

```java
for (type variableName : arrayName) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

The following example outputs all elements in the `cars` array using a "for-each" loop:

#### Example

```java
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

> **Note:** Don't worry if you don't understand the example above. You will learn more about Arrays in the Java Arrays chapter.
