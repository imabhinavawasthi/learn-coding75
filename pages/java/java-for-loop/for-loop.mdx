### Java For Loop

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the `for` loop instead of a `while` loop:

### Syntax

```java
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

- **Statement 1** is executed **once** before the execution of the code block.
- **Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.
- **Statement 3** is executed **every time** after the code block has been executed.

The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:

#### Example

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

### Example Explained

- **Statement 1** sets a variable before the loop starts (`int i = 0`).
- **Statement 2** defines the condition for the loop to run (`i` must be less than `5`). If the condition is `true`, the loop continues; otherwise, it stops.
- **Statement 3** increases a value (`i++`) each time the code block executes.

#### Another Example

This example prints only even values between `0` and `10`:

```java
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
