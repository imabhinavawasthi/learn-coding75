# Introduction to Java

Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language widely used for building applications, ranging from web and mobile apps to enterprise systems and embedded devices. It follows the **"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)** principle, meaning Java programs can run on any platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# Installing Java

Before writing Java programs, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK).

## Step 1: Download and Install JDK

- Visit the official Oracle website: [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- Choose the appropriate version for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Install the JDK and set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

Ensure that you download the latest **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version for better stability and support.

## Step 2: Verify Installation

Open a terminal or command prompt and type:

```sh
java -version
```

If Java is installed correctly, you should see output similar to:

```sh
java version "17.0.1" 2021-10-19 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.1+12-LTS-39)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.1+12-LTS-39, mixed mode)
```

# Writing Your First Java Program

Once Java is installed, let's write a simple program.

1. Open a text editor (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Notepad++).
2. Create a new file named `HelloWorld.java`.
3. Add the following code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

4. Save the file and open a terminal in the same directory.

## Compiling and Running Java Code

To compile the program, run:

```sh
javac HelloWorld.java
```

This generates a `HelloWorld.class` file. Now, run the program:

```sh
java HelloWorld
```

**Output:**

```sh
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've successfully written and executed your first Java program.
