## Java While Loop

### Loops

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and make code more readable.

### Java While Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`:

### Syntax

```java
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

In the example below, the code in the loop will run repeatedly as long as a variable (`i`) is less than 5:

#### Example

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}
```

> **Note:** Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise, the loop will never end!
