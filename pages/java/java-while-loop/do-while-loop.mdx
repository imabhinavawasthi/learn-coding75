## Java Do/While Loop

### The Do/While Loop

The `do/while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop. This loop will execute the code block **once** before checking if the condition is `true`, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is `true`.

### Syntax

```java
do {
  // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```

The example below uses a `do/while` loop. The loop will always be executed **at least once**, even if the condition is `false`, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

#### Example

```java
int i = 0;
do {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

> **Note:** Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise, the loop will never end!
