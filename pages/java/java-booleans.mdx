## Boolean Expression

A Boolean expression returns a boolean value: `true` or `false`.

This is useful to build logic and find answers.

For example, you can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (`>`) operator, to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true or false:

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 9;
System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 10 is higher than 9
```

Or even easier:

```java
System.out.println(10 > 9); // returns true, because 10 is higher than 9
```

In the examples below, we use the equal to (`==`) operator to evaluate an expression:

```java
int x = 10;
System.out.println(x == 10); // returns true, because the value of x is equal to 10
```

```java
System.out.println(10 == 15); // returns false, because 10 is not equal to 15
```

## Real Life Example

Let's think of a "real life example" where we need to find out if a person is old enough to vote.

In the example below, we use the `>=` comparison operator to find out if the age (`25`) is greater than or equal to the voting age limit (`18`):

```java
int myAge = 25;
int votingAge = 18;
System.out.println(myAge >= votingAge);
```

Cool, right? An even better approach would be to wrap the code above in an `if...else` statement, so we can perform different actions depending on the result:

```java
int myAge = 25;
int votingAge = 18;

if (myAge >= votingAge) {
  System.out.println("Old enough to vote!");
} else {
  System.out.println("Not old enough to vote.");
}
```
