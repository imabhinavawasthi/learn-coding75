## Java Threads

### Introduction to Threads

Threads allow a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.

Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.

### Creating a Thread

There are two ways to create a thread:

1. By extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method:

```java
public class Main extends Thread {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}
```

2. By implementing the `Runnable` interface:

```java
public class Main implements Runnable {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}
```

### Running Threads

If the class extends the `Thread` class, the thread can be started using `start()`:

```java
public class Main extends Thread {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main thread = new Main();
    thread.start();
    System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
  }
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}
```

If the class implements `Runnable`, the thread is started by passing an instance to a `Thread` object:

```java
public class Main implements Runnable {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main obj = new Main();
    Thread thread = new Thread(obj);
    thread.start();
    System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
  }
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}
```

### Concurrency Problems

Since threads run simultaneously, execution order is unpredictable. This can cause concurrency problems when multiple threads modify shared data.

Example of concurrency issue:

```java
public class Main extends Thread {
  public static int amount = 0;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main thread = new Main();
    thread.start();
    System.out.println(amount);
    amount++;
    System.out.println(amount);
  }
  public void run() {
    amount++;
  }
}
```

To avoid such issues, use `isAlive()` to check if a thread has finished execution:

```java
public class Main extends Thread {
  public static int amount = 0;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main thread = new Main();
    thread.start();
    while(thread.isAlive()) {
      System.out.println("Waiting...");
    }
    System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
    amount++;
    System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
  }
  public void run() {
    amount++;
  }
}
```
