# Java Thread.start() vs Thread.run() Method

In Javaâ€™s multi-threading concept, `start()` and `run()` are the two most important methods. Below are the main differences between `Thread.start()` and `Thread.run()` in Java.

### Differences

| Thread.start() | Thread.run() |
|--------------|--------------|
| Creates a new thread and executes `run()` on the newly created thread. | No new thread is created; `run()` executes on the calling thread. |
| Cannot be invoked more than once (throws `java.lang.IllegalStateException`). | Can be invoked multiple times. |
| Defined in `java.lang.Thread` class. | Defined in `java.lang.Runnable` interface and must be overridden in the implementing class. |

### New Thread Creation
When `start()` is called, a new thread is created, and `run()` is executed within it. If `run()` is called directly, no new thread is created; execution happens in the main thread.

#### Example 1: Using `start()`
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Current thread name: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        System.out.println("run() method called");
    }
}

class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Current thread name: Thread-0
run() method called
```

#### Example 2: Using `run()` directly
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Current thread name: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        System.out.println("run() method called");
    }
}

class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.run();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Current thread name: main
run() method called
```

### Multiple Invocation
Calling `start()` more than once throws an exception, while `run()` can be called multiple times.

#### Example 1: Multiple calls to `start()`
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Current thread name: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        System.out.println("run() method called");
    }
}

class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
        t.start();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Current thread name: Thread-0
run() method called
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException
```

#### Example 2: Multiple calls to `run()`
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Current thread name: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        System.out.println("run() method called");
    }
}

class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.run();
        t.run();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Current thread name: main
run() method called
Current thread name: main
run() method called
```
