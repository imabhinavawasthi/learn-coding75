## Interface Runnable

### All Known Subinterfaces:
- `RunnableFuture<V>`
- `RunnableScheduledFuture<V>`

### All Known Implementing Classes:
- `AsyncBoxView.ChildState`
- `ForkJoinWorkerThread`
- `FutureTask`
- `RenderableImageProducer`
- `SwingWorker`
- `Thread`
- `TimerTask`

### Functional Interface:
This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Runnable
```

The `Runnable` interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The class must define a method of no arguments called `run`.

This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that wish to execute code while they are active. For example, `Runnable` is implemented by class `Thread`. Being active simply means that a thread has been started and has not yet been stopped.

In addition, `Runnable` provides the means for a class to be active while not subclassing `Thread`. A class that implements `Runnable` can run without subclassing `Thread` by instantiating a `Thread` instance and passing itself in as the target. In most cases, the `Runnable` interface should be used if you are only planning to override the `run()` method and no other `Thread` methods. This is important because classes should not be subclassed unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental behavior of the class.

## Method Summary

### All Methods
- **Instance Methods**
- **Abstract Methods**

#### Modifier and Type | Method and Description
--- | ---
`void` | `run()`

When an object implementing interface `Runnable` is used to create a thread, starting the thread causes the object's `run` method to be called in that separately executing thread.

## Method Detail

### `run()`
```java
void run()
```

When an object implementing interface `Runnable` is used to create a thread, starting the thread causes the object's `run` method to be called in that separately executing thread.

The general contract of the method `run` is that it may take any action whatsoever.
