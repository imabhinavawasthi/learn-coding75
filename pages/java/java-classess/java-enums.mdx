## Java Enums

### Enums

An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

To create an enum, use the `enum` keyword (instead of `class` or `interface`), and separate the constants with a comma. Note that they should be in uppercase letters:

```java
enum Level {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
}
```

You can access enum constants with the dot syntax:

```java
Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM;
```

Enum is short for "enumerations", which means "specifically listed".

### Enum inside a Class

You can also have an enum inside a class:

```java
public class Main {
  enum Level {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
    System.out.println(myVar);
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```
MEDIUM
```

### Enum in a Switch Statement

Enums are often used in switch statements to check for corresponding values:

```java
enum Level {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM;

    switch(myVar) {
      case LOW:
        System.out.println("Low level");
        break;
      case MEDIUM:
        System.out.println("Medium level");
        break;
      case HIGH:
        System.out.println("High level");
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Medium level
```

### Loop Through an Enum

The enum type has a `values()` method, which returns an array of all enum constants. This method is useful when you want to loop through the constants of an enum:

```java
for (Level myVar : Level.values()) {
  System.out.println(myVar);
}
```

**Output:**
```
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
```

### Difference between Enums and Classes

An enum can, just like a class, have attributes and methods. The only difference is that enum constants are `public`, `static`, and `final` (unchangeable - cannot be overridden).

An enum **cannot** be used to create objects, and it **cannot** extend other classes (but it can implement interfaces).

### Why And When To Use Enums?

Use enums when you have values that you know aren't going to change, like month days, days, colors, deck of cards, etc.
