## Java Class Methods

You learned from the Java Methods chapter that methods are declared within a class, and that they are used to perform certain actions:

### Example
Create a method named `myMethod()` in `Main`:

```java
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

`myMethod()` prints a text (the action) when it is called. To call a method, write the method's name followed by two parentheses `()` and a semicolon `;`.

### Example: Calling `myMethod()` Inside `main`

```java
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello World!
```

### Static vs. Public Methods

You will often see Java programs that have either `static` or `public` attributes and methods.

In the example above, we created a `static` method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike `public`, which can only be accessed by objects.

### Example: Demonstrating Static and Public Methods

```java
public class Main {
  // Static method
  static void myStaticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
  }

  // Public method
  public void myPublicMethod() {
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");
  }

  // Main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myStaticMethod(); // Call the static method
    // myPublicMethod(); This would compile an error

    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of Main
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Call the public method on the object
  }
}
```

**Note:** You will learn more about these keywords (called modifiers) in the Java Modifiers chapter.

## Access Methods With an Object

### Example: Creating and Calling Methods on an Object

```java
public class Main {
  // Create a fullThrottle() method
  public void fullThrottle() {
    System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
  }

  // Create a speed() method and add a parameter
  public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
    System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);
  }

  // Inside main, call the methods on the myCar object
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myCar = new Main();   // Create a myCar object
    myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method
    myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() method
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```
The car is going as fast as it can!
Max speed is: 200
```

### Explanation:
1) We created a custom `Main` class with the `class` keyword.
2) We created the `fullThrottle()` and `speed()` methods in the `Main` class.
3) The `fullThrottle()` and `speed()` methods print out some text when called.
4) The `speed()` method accepts an `int` parameter called `maxSpeed` (used in step 8).
5) To use the `Main` class and its methods, we need to create an object of the `Main` class.
6) In the `main()` method, which is a built-in Java method, we execute our program.
7) Using the `new` keyword, we created an object named `myCar`.
8) We then call the `fullThrottle()` and `speed(200)` methods on the `myCar` object.

## Using Multiple Classes

Like we specified in the Classes chapter, it is a good practice to create an object of a class and access it in another class.

### Example: Using Multiple Classes

#### **Main.java**
```java
public class Main {
  public void fullThrottle() {
    System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
  }

  public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
    System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);
  }
}
```

#### **Second.java**
```java
class Second {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myCar = new Main();     // Create a myCar object
    myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method
    myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() method
  }
}
```

### Compiling and Running

When both files have been compiled:
```
C:\Users\Your Name>javac Main.java
C:\Users\Your Name>javac Second.java
```

Run the `Second.java` file:
```
C:\Users\Your Name>java Second
```

**Output:**
```
The car is going as fast as it can!
Max speed is: 200
```

### Key Takeaways
- The dot (`.`) is used to access the object's attributes and methods.
- To call a method in Java, write the method name followed by parentheses `()`, then a semicolon `;`.
- A class must have a matching filename (e.g., `Main` and `Main.java`).
