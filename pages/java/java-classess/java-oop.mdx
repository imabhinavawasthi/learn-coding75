## Java OOP

### Java - What is OOP?

OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

- OOP is faster and easier to execute.
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
- OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY (*Don't Repeat Yourself*), making the code easier to maintain, modify, and debug.
- OOP makes it possible to create fully reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

**Tip:** The *Don't Repeat Yourself* (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the common code in the application, place it in a single location, and reuse it instead of repeating it.

### Java - What are Classes and Objects?

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

Look at the following illustration to see the difference between a class and objects:

#### Example 1:

**Class:** `Fruit`

**Objects:**
- Apple
- Banana
- Mango

#### Example 2:

**Class:** `Car`

**Objects:**
- Volvo
- Audi
- Toyota

So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

When individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.

You will learn much more about classes and objects in the next chapter.
