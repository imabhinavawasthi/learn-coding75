# Java Comments

Comments can be used to explain Java code and make it more readable. They can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

## Single-line Comments

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`).

Any text between `//` and the end of the line is ignored by Java (it will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

```java
// This is a comment
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:

```java
System.out.println("Hello World"); // This is a comment
```

## Java Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by Java.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

```java
/* The code below will print the words Hello World
   to the screen, and it is amazing */
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

## Single or Multi-line Comments?

It's up to you which one you use. Normally, we use `//` for short comments and `/* */` for longer ones.
