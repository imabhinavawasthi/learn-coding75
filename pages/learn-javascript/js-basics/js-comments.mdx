## JavaScript Comments

Comments are used to explain your code and make it easier to understand. They are ignored by JavaScript and do not affect how the code runs.

### 1. Single Line Comments
A single-line comment in JavaScript starts with //. Anything after // on that line is ignored by JavaScript and does not get executed.

```javascript
// A single line comment  
console.log("Hello Coders!");    
```

**Output:**
```
Hello Coders!
```

### 2. Multi-line Comments
A multiline comment begins with `/*` and ends with `*/`

```javascript
/* It is multi line comment.  
It will not be displayed upon 
execution of this code */  

console.log("Multiline comment in javascript");  
```

**Output:**
```
Multiline comment in javascript
```

## JavaScript Comments in HTML

**Prerequisite:** [How to Add JavaScript in HTML Document?](#)

The syntax of comments remains the same when we write inside the HTML `<script>` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        // Printing Hello World
        document.write('Hello World');
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## JavaScript Comments to Prevent Execution

We can use `//` or `/*â€¦*/` to change the JavaScript code execution using comments. JavaScript Comments are used to prevent code execution and are considered suitable for testing the code.

```javascript
function add() {
    let x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    let z = x + y;
    // console.log(x + y);
    console.log(z);
}

add();
```

**Output:**
```
30
```

### Example 2: Multi-line comments to prevent execution of addition code and perform subtraction operations.

```javascript
function sub() {
    let x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    /* let z = x + y;
    console.log(z); */

    let z = x - y;
    console.log(z);
}

sub();
```

**Output:**
```
