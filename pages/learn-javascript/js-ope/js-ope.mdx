# JavaScript Operators

JavaScript operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables. They are the building blocks of JavaScript expressions and can manipulate data in various ways.

## JavaScript Operators

There are various operators supported by JavaScript.

### 1. JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

```js
const sum = 5 + 3; // Addition
const diff = 10 - 2; // Subtraction
const p = 4 * 2; // Multiplication
const q = 8 / 2; // Division
console.log(sum, diff, p, q);
```

**Output:**
```
8 8 8 4
```

- `+` adds two numbers.
- `-` subtracts the second number from the first.
- `*` multiplies two numbers.
- `/` divides the first number by the second.

### 2. JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform operations like addition or multiplication before assigning the value.

```js
let n = 10;
n += 5;
n *= 2;
console.log(n);
```

**Output:**
```
30
```

- `=` assigns a value to a variable.
- `+=` adds and assigns the result to the variable.
- `*=` multiplies and assigns the result to the variable.

### 3. JavaScript Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean (`true` or `false`). They are useful for making decisions in conditional statements.

```js
console.log(10 > 5);
console.log(10 === "10");
```

**Output:**
```
true
false
```

- `>` checks if the left value is greater than the right.
- `===` checks for strict equality (both type and value).
- Other operators include `<`, `<=`, `>=`, and `!==`.

### 4. JavaScript Logical Operators

Logical operators perform logical operations that determine equality or difference between values.

```js
const a = true, b = false;
console.log(a && b); // Logical AND
console.log(a || b); // Logical OR
```

**Output:**
```
false
true
```

- `&&` returns `true` if both operands are `true`.
- `||` returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.
- `!` negates the boolean value.

### 5. JavaScript Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers.

```js
const res = 5 & 1; // Bitwise AND
console.log(res);
```

**Output:**
```
1
```

- `&` performs a bitwise AND.
- `|` performs a bitwise OR.
- `^` performs a bitwise XOR.
- `~` performs a bitwise NOT.

### 6. JavaScript Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for conditional statements. It takes three operands.

```js
const age = 18;
const status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(status);
```

**Output:**
```
Adult
```

- `condition ? expression1 : expression2` evaluates `expression1` if the condition is `true`, otherwise evaluates `expression2`.

### 7. JavaScript Comma Operator

The comma operator `(,)` evaluates its operands from left to right and returns the value of the rightmost operand.

```js
let n1, n2;
const res = (n1 = 1, n2 = 2, n1 + n2);
console.log(res);
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

- Each expression is evaluated from left to right.
- The final result of the expression is the rightmost value.

### 8. JavaScript Unary Operators

Unary operators operate on a single operand (e.g., increment, decrement).

```js
let x = 5;
console.log(++x); // Pre-increment
console.log(x--); // Post-decrement (Output: 6, then x becomes 5)
```

**Output:**
```
6
6
```

- `++` increments the value by 1.
- `--` decrements the value by 1.
- `typeof` returns the type of a variable.

### 9. JavaScript Relational Operators

Relational operators compare operands and determine relationships between them.

```js
const obj = { length: 10 };
console.log("length" in obj);
console.log([] instanceof Array);
```

**Output:**
```
true
true
```

- `in` checks if a property exists in an object.
- `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a constructor.

### 10. JavaScript BigInt Operators

BigInt operators allow calculations with numbers beyond the safe integer range.

```js
const big1 = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
const big2 = 987654321098765432109876543210n;
console.log(big1 + big2);
```

**Output:**
```
1111111110111111111011111111100n
```

- Operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication work with `BigInt`.
- Use `n` suffix to denote `BigInt` literals.

### 11. JavaScript String Operators

JavaScript string operators include concatenation (`+`) and concatenation assignment (`+=`).

```js
const s = "Hello" + " " + "World";
console.log(s);
```

**Output:**
```
Hello World
```

- `+` concatenates strings.
- `+=` appends to an existing string.

### 12. JavaScript Chaining Operator (`?.`)

The optional chaining operator allows safe access to deeply nested properties.

```js
const obj = { name: "Aman", address: { city: "Delhi" } };
console.log(obj.address?.city);
console.log(obj.contact?.phone);
```

**Output:**
```
Delhi
undefined
```

- `?.` safely accesses a property or method.
- Returns `undefined` if the property doesnâ€™t exist.
