## Operator Precedence in JavaScript

Operator precedence refers to the priority given to operators while parsing a statement that has more than one operator performing operations in it. Operators with higher priorities are resolved first. But as one goes down the list, the priority decreases and hence their resolution.

- `*` and `/` have higher precedence than `+` and `-`

### Precedence and Associativity

The associativity represents which operator has to be solved first while going from left to right if two or more operators have the same precedence in the expression.

#### Example:
```javascript
2 + 3 * 4 / 3 // 6
```
The precedence of the multiply (`*`) and divide (`/`) operators is the same, but due to left-to-right associativity, the multiply operator will be resolved first, resulting in `6`.

## Operator Precedence and Associativity Table

The operator precedence and associativity table can help determine the precedence of an operator relative to others. As one goes down the table, the precedence of these operators decreases. Operators listed under the same precedence level share the same priority and associativity.

| Precedence | Operator | Description | Associativity | Example |
|------------|----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | `()` | Grouping | – | `(1+2)` |
| 2 | `.` | Member | Left to Right | `obj.function` |
| 2.1 | `[]` | Member | Left to Right | `brand["carName"]` |
| 2.2 | `new` | Create | – | `new Date("July 27, 2023")` |
| 2.3 | `()` | Function Call | – | `myFun()` |
| 3 | `++` | Postfix increment | N/A | `i++` |
| 3.1 | `--` | Postfix decrement | N/A | `i--` |
