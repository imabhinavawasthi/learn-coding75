## Do-While Loop
A do-while loop in JavaScript works like a while loop but always executes the code at least once, even if the condition is false initially. It then keeps running as long as the condition is true.

### Syntax
```javascript
do {
    // Code block to be executed 
} while (condition);
```

### Example: Counting from 1 to 5

```javascript
let count = 1;
do {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
} while (count <= 5);
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
### Parameters

- **statement**  
  A statement that is executed at least once and re-executed as long as the condition evaluates to `true`.  
  You can use a block statement (`{ ... }`) to execute multiple statements.

- **condition**  
  An expression evaluated after each pass through the loop.  
  If this condition evaluates to `true`, the statement is re-executed.  
  When the condition evaluates to `false`, execution continues with the statement after the `do...while` loop.

## Description

Like other looping statements, you can use control flow statements inside `do...while`:

- `break` stops statement execution and goes to the first statement after the loop.
- `continue` stops the current iteration and re-evaluates the condition for the next pass.

>  The `do...while` statement syntax requires a semicolon at the end, but JavaScriptâ€™s automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) might add one if it's missing.

## Comparison Between While and Do-While Loop
| While Loop | Do-While Loop |
|------------|--------------|
| It is an **entry condition** looping structure. | It is an **exit condition** looping structure. |
| The number of iterations depends on the condition mentioned in the `while` block. | Irrespective of the condition mentioned in the `do-while` block, there will be a minimum of 1 iteration. |
| The block control condition is available at the **starting point** of the loop. | The block control condition is available at the **endpoint** of the loop. |
