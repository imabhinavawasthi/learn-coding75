## Variables and Datatypes in JavaScript

Variables and data types are foundational concepts in programming, serving as the building blocks for storing and manipulating information within a program. In JavaScript, getting a good grasp of these concepts is important for writing code that works well and is easy to understand.

## Variables

A variable is like a container that holds data that can be reused or updated later in the program. In JavaScript, variables are declared using the keywords `var`, `let`, or `const`.

### 1. `var` Keyword

The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable. It has a function-scoped or globally-scoped behavior.

```javascript
var n = 5;
console.log(n);

var n = 20; // reassigning is allowed
console.log(n);
```

**Output:**
```
5
20
```

### 2. `let` Keyword

The `let` keyword is introduced in ES6, has block scope, and cannot be re-declared in the same scope.

```javascript
let n = 10;
n = 20; // Value can be updated
// let n = 15; // Cannot redeclare
console.log(n);
```

**Output:**
```
20
```

### 3. `const` Keyword

The `const` keyword declares variables that cannot be reassigned. It’s block-scoped as well.

```javascript
const n = 100;
// n = 200; This will throw an error
console.log(n);
```

**Output:**
```
100
```

## Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types, which can be broadly categorized into **primitive** and **non-primitive** types.

### Primitive Datatypes

Primitive datatypes represent single values and are immutable.

#### 1. Number
Represents numeric values (integers and decimals).

```javascript
let n = 42;
let pi = 3.14;
```

#### 2. String
Represents text enclosed in single or double quotes.

```javascript
let s = "Hello, World!";
```

#### 3. Boolean
Represents a logical value (`true` or `false`).

```javascript
let bool = true;
```

#### 4. Undefined
A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

```javascript
let notAssigned;
console.log(notAssigned);
```

**Output:**
```
undefined
```

#### 5. Null
Represents an intentional absence of any value.

```javascript
let empty = null;
```

#### 6. Symbol
Represents unique and immutable values, often used as object keys.

```javascript
let sym = Symbol('unique');
```

#### 7. BigInt
Represents integers larger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.

```javascript
let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

### Non-Primitive Datatypes

Non-primitive types are objects and can store collections of data or more complex entities.

#### 1. Object
Represents key-value pairs.

```javascript
let obj = {
    name: "Amit",
    age: 25
};
```

#### 2. Array
Represents an ordered list of values.

```javascript
let a = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

#### 3. Function
Represents reusable blocks of code.

```javascript
function fun() {
    console.log("Coding75");
}
