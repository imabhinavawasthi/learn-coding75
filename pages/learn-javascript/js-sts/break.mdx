title: "JavaScript Break Statement"

JavaScript `break` statement is used to terminate the execution of the loop or the switch statement when the condition is true.

## In Switch Block (To come out of the block)

```javascript
const fruit = "Mango";

switch (fruit) {
    case "Apple":
        console.log("Apple is healthy.");
        break;
    case "Mango":
        console.log("Mango is delicious.");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("No fruit chosen.");
}
```

### Output
```plaintext
Mango is delicious.
```

## Why do we need to use break with Switch?

In the below example, the fruit name is `Apple`, but the given output is for the two cases. This is because of the missing `break` statement in the case of `Apple`. The block will run for the next case as well until a `break` statement appears.

```javascript
const fruit = "Apple";

switch (fruit) {
    case "Apple":
        console.log("Apple is healthy.");
    case "Mango":
        console.log("Mango is delicious.");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("No fruit chosen.");
}
```

### Output
```plaintext
Apple is healthy.
Mango is delicious.
```

## In a For Loop (To come out of the Loop)

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
    if (i == 4) break;
    console.log(i);
}
```

### Output
```plaintext
1
2
3
```

## While and Do-While Loop Examples

```javascript
// Using break in a while loop
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    if (i === 3) {
        break;
    }
    i++;
}

// Using break in a do-while loop
let j = 1;
do {
    console.log(j);
    if (j === 3) {
        break;
    }
    j++;
} while (j <= 5);
```

### Output
```plaintext
1
2
3
1
2
3
```

## Break with Labels

In JavaScript, we can use a `break` statement with a label to exit from a specific loop, even if itâ€™s nested inside another loop. This is useful when you need to break out of a nested loop structure, and just using a simple `break` would only exit the innermost loop.

```javascript
outerLoop:
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (i === 1 && j === 1) {
            break outerLoop;  
        }
        console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);
    }
}
```

### Output
```plaintext
i: 0, j: 0
i: 0, j: 1
i: 0, j: 2
i: 1, j: 0
