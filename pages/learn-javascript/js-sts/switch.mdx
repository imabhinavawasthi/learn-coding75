## JavaScript switch Statement

_Last Updated: 21 Nov, 2024_

The JavaScript `switch` statement evaluates an expression and executes a block of code based on matching cases. It provides an alternative to long `if-else` chains, improving readability and maintainability, especially when handling multiple conditional branches.

### Switch Statement Example
Here, we will print the day name on day 3.

```javascript
let day = 3;
let dayName;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        dayName = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        dayName = "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        dayName = "Thursday";
        break;
    case 5:
        dayName = "Friday";
        break;
    case 6:
        dayName = "Saturday";
        break;
    case 7:
        dayName = "Sunday";
        break;
    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
}

console.log(dayName); // Output: Wednesday
```

**Output:**
```
Wednesday
```

### Explanation
- `day` is set to `3`.
- The `switch` statement evaluates `day`.
- Since `day` is `3`, the `case 3` block is executed, assigning "Wednesday" to `dayName`.
- The `break` statement ends the `switch` statement, preventing execution from continuing into other cases.

### Switch Statement Syntax
```javascript
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code block 1;
        break;
    case value2:
        // code block 2;
        break;
    ...
    default:
        // default code block;
}
```

- `expression` is the value that you want to compare.
- `case value1`, `case value2`, etc., represent the possible values of the expression.
- `break` statement terminates the `switch` statement. Without it, execution will continue into the next case.
- `default` specifies the code to run if none of the cases match the expression.

### How Switch Statement Works
1. **Evaluation**: The expression inside the `switch` statement is evaluated once.
2. **Comparison**: The value of the expression is compared with each case label (using strict equality `===`).
3. **Execution**: If a match is found, the corresponding code block following the matching case label is executed. If no match is found, execution jumps to the `default` case (if present) or continues with the next statement after the `switch` block.
4. **Break Statement**: After executing a code block, the `break` statement terminates the `switch` statement, preventing execution from falling through to subsequent cases. If `break` is omitted, execution will continue to the next case (known as “fall-through”).
5. **Default Case**: The `default` case is optional. If no match is found, the code block under `default` is executed.

### Example: Checking Grade using Switch Case
```javascript
let grade = 'B';
let result;

switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
        result = "A (Excellent)";
        break;
    case 'B':
        result = "B (Average)";
        break;
    case 'C':
        result = "C (Below than average)";
        break;
    default:
        result = "No Grade";
}

console.log(result);
```

**Output:**
```
B (Average)
```

### Explanation
- `grade` is assigned the value `'B'`.
- The `switch` statement evaluates `grade`.
- Since `grade` is `'B'`, the code block following `case 'B':` is executed.
- The `result` variable is assigned the string "B (Average)".
- The `break` statement terminates the `switch` statement.
- `result` is logged to the console, which outputs "B (Average)".

### Break Keyword
The `break` keyword is used to terminate the execution of a loop or a `switch` statement.

### default Keyword
The `default` keyword is used within a `switch` statement as a fallback option when none of the `case` expressions match the value being evaluated. It acts similarly to the `else` statement in an `if...else` chain, providing a default action to take when no other specific cases match.

#### Position of default case does not matter
Regardless of its placement, the `default` case only gets executed if none of the other case conditions are met. So, putting it at the beginning, middle, or end doesn’t change the core logic (unless you’re using a less common technique called fall-through).

#### Example: Printing the Default Case
```javascript
let day = 8;
let dayName;

switch (day) {
    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
        break;
    case 1:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        dayName = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        dayName = "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        dayName = "Thursday";
        break;
    case 5:
        dayName = "Friday";
        break;
    case 6:
        dayName = "Saturday";
        break;
    case 7:
        dayName = "Sunday";
        break;
}

console.log(dayName);
```

**Output:**
```
Invalid day
```

### Common Code Blocks in Switch Statements
In some cases, we need to use the same code for multiple `switch` cases. Let’s see an example of how to do it:

#### Common Code Blocks Example
Here, we will use the same code block for two different `switch` cases.

```javascript
let grade = 'A';
let result;

switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
        result = "Grade is excellent";
        break;
    case 'B':
        result = "Grade is good";
        break;
    case 'C':
        result = "Grade is Average ";
        break;
    case 'D':
        result = "Grade is Poor";
        break;
    default:
        result = "NO grades achieved";
}

console.log(result);
```

**Output:**
```
Grade is excellent
```

### Explanation
- `grade` is assigned the value `'A'`.
- The `switch` statement evaluates the value of `grade`.
- Since `grade` matches `'A'`, the code block following `case 'A':` is executed, setting `result` to "Grade is excellent".
- The `break` statement terminates the `switch` statement.
- `result` is logged to the console, which outputs "Grade is excellent".

**Note:** If multiple `switch` cases match a value, the first matching case is executed.
