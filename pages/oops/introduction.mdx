# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a methodology or paradigm for designing software through the utilization of **classes** and **objects**.  
It streamlines both software development and maintenance.

OOP consists of:

### ● Class

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the **attributes (data)** and **behaviors (methods)** that objects of that class will have.

> Think of a class as a cookie cutter, and objects as the cookies made from that cutter.

A class typically includes:

- **Attributes**
- **Methods**
- **Constructor**
- **Destructor**  

### ● Object

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific realization of the attributes and behaviors defined by its class. Objects are created during run-time.

An object includes:

- **State**
- **Behavior**
- **Identity** (accessible via the `this` keyword)
