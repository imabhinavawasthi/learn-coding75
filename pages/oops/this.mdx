## `this` Keyword / Pointer

The keyword **`this`** refers to the **current instance** of the class.  
It plays a crucial role in **object-oriented programming** by providing a reference to the calling object.

### Primary Uses of `this`:

1. It can **pass the current object** as a parameter to another method.
2. It can **refer to the current class instance variable**, especially when there’s a naming conflict with method parameters.
3. It can be used to **declare indexers** (in some languages like C#).
