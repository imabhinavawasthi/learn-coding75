## Key Concepts of OOPs

There are **4 main concepts** (also called components or pillars) of Object-Oriented Programming:

## Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a core feature of OOP where a class can acquire **properties and behaviors** from another class.  
It allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones, promoting **code reuse and specialization**.

When inheritance occurs:

- A new class, known as the **derived class** or **child class**, is formed.
- It inherits from an existing class called the **base class** or **parent class**.

The derived class:

- **Inherits** all properties of the base class.
- Can **introduce additional features** or override existing ones.
- Does **not affect** the base class when changes are made.

> **Subclass / Derived Class**: The class that inherits.  
> **Superclass / Base Class**: The class that is inherited from.

## Types of Inheritance

### ● Single Inheritance

A class inherits from **only one parent class**, forming a **simple hierarchical relationship**.  
The subclass extends and specializes functionalities of the superclass.

### ● Multiple Inheritance

A class inherits from **more than one parent class**, combining features from all.  
> Not supported directly in Java.

### ● Multilevel Inheritance

A class inherits from another class, and then another class inherits from that derived class.  
This forms a **chain of inheritance**.

### ● Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple classes **inherit from a single base class**.

### ● Hybrid Inheritance

inheritance mechanism that blends together the features of simple inheritance, multiple inheritance, and hierarchical inheritance.
