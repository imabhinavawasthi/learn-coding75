## Exceptions in OOP

**Exceptions** are mechanisms for managing **unexpected or erroneous conditions** that arise during program execution.  
They allow developers to gracefully **handle errors** without crashing the entire application.

---

### Why Use Exceptions?

- To separate **error-handling code** from regular code.
- To catch **runtime errors** and respond with defined behavior.
- To make code more **robust and readable**.

---

### Common Exception Types

Each programming language has its own exception hierarchy, but common types include:

- **Syntax errors**
- **Runtime errors**
- **Logical errors**
- **Custom exceptions** (user-defined)

## Exception Handling

**Exception Handling** is the practice of catching and managing potential errors in a program to maintain smooth execution.

---

### How It Works

- **try block**: Code that may raise an exception is placed here.
- **catch block** (or **except** in Python): Contains code to execute if an exception occurs.
- **finally block** (optional): Code that is always executed, whether or not an exception occurs.

### Benefits:

- Prevents **abrupt termination** of the program.
- Allows for **custom error responses**.
- Helps build **fault-tolerant** and **user-friendly** software.

### Syntax Example (General Structure):

```java
try {
    // code that may throw exception
} catch (ExceptionType name) {
    // code to handle the exception
} finally {
    // optional block that always executes
}
