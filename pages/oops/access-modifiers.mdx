## Access Modifiers

Also called **visibility modes**, access modifiers dictate the **accessibility of members** (attributes and methods) of a class, especially in **inheritance relationships**.

There are typically **three visibility modes**:

### 1. Public

- Public members are accessible from **outside the class** as well as by **subclasses**.
- Inheritance **does not alter** the accessibility of public members.
- They **remain accessible** in subclasses.

### 2. Protected

- Protected members are accessible **within the class itself** and by its **subclasses**.
- Subclasses can access protected members **inherited from the superclass**.
- They are **not accessible outside** the class hierarchy.

### 3. Private

- Private members are **only accessible within** the class where they are defined.
- Inheritance **does not grant** access to private members in subclasses.
- They **cannot be accessed directly** by subclasses.
