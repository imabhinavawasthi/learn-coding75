## Constructor

A **constructor** is a unique method that is automatically called during the creation of an object.  
Its primary purpose is to **initialize the data members** of newly created objects. In **C++**, the constructor shares the same name as the class or structure it belongs to.

### Types of Constructors:

1. **Default Constructor**  
   A constructor without any arguments is referred to as a **default constructor**.  
   It is automatically called during the creation of an object.

2. **Parameterized Constructor**  
   A constructor with parameters is termed as a **parameterized constructor**.  
   It is utilized to supply different values to individual objects.

3. **Copy Constructor** *(Important)*  
   A **copy constructor** is an overloaded constructor used to declare and initialize an object based on another object.  
   It comes in two forms:
   - The default copy constructor provided by the language
   - The user-defined copy constructor

## Destructor

A **destructor** in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object is **destroyed** or **goes out of scope**.  
Its primary purpose is to perform **cleanup tasks**, such as:

- Releasing memory
- Closing file handles
- Disconnecting database connections

## `this` Keyword / Pointer

The keyword **`this`** refers to the **current instance** of the class.  
It serves three main purposes:

1. It can pass the current object as a parameter to another method.  
2. It can refer to the current class instance variable.  
3. It can declare indexers.
