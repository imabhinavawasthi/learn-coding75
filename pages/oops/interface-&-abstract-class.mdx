## Interface in OOPs

An **interface** in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a blueprint of a class that defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. It specifies a contract that classes must adhere to, outlining the methods they must provide without specifying the implementation details.

C++ does not provide the exact equivalent of Java interface. In C++, overriding a virtual function can only be done in a derived class of the class
with the virtual function declaration, whereas in Java, the overrider for a method in an interface can be declared in a base class.

It acts as a **contract**:  
- It defines **what** methods a class must implement  
- But **not how** they are implemented  

Interfaces help achieve **abstraction** and **polymorphism** by allowing different classes to follow a common structure.

### Key Points:

- Interfaces **only define method signatures**, not method bodies.
- A class can **implement multiple interfaces** (supports multiple inheritance of type).
- Promotes **decoupling** and **testability**.

> **Note for C++:**  
> C++ does not have native interface support like Java.  
> Instead, **abstract classes** with only pure virtual functions act like interfaces.

## Abstract Classes

An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to be inherited by other classes.

It allows you to:
- Define **abstract methods** (without implementation)
- Provide **concrete methods** (with default implementations)
- Serve as a **base** for subclasses, enforcing a shared structure and behavior

### Key Characteristics:

1. Cannot be instantiated directly
2. Can have **abstract methods** (must be implemented by subclass)
3. Can have **concrete methods** (may be inherited or overridden)
4. Can include member variables like regular classes
5. Helps in organizing **common functionality** in a central location

### Abstract Classes vs Interfaces (Java):

- **Abstract Class**: Can have constructors, variables, concrete and abstract methods  
- **Interface**: Cannot have constructors, only method declarations (until Java 8, after which default/static methods are allowed)
