# What is Operating System?
An **Operating System** acts like an interface between you and your computer's hardware.  
It handles tasks like:

- Running programs  
- Managing resources  
- Taking care of the CPU  
- Organizing files  

The main goal of an operating system is to create a **user-friendly** and **efficient** environment for running programs.

# Types of OS

- **Batch OS**: It works by storing similar jobs in the computer's memory. The CPU handles one job at a time, waiting for the current one to  
  finish before moving on to the next.

- **Multiprogramming OS**: In this system, the computer's memory holds several jobs waiting for their turn with the CPU. When one job has to  
  wait for something, like input/output operations, the operating system switches to another job. This way, the CPU is always busy, and you can  
  have multiple tasks running simultaneously.

- **Multitasking OS**: Combining aspects of Multiprogramming and CPU scheduling, a multitasking OS quickly switches between different jobs.  
  This rapid switching allows users to interact with each program as it runs, giving the impression of doing multiple tasks at the same time.

- **Time Sharing OS**: These systems involve direct interaction with the user. Users give instructions to the OS through input devices like  
  keyboards, and the OS responds with output. It's like taking turns to use the computer.

- **Real-Time OS**: Designed for specific tasks with strict deadlines,real-time operating systems are often used in dedicated systems.  
  They focus on completing particular jobs within specific time limits.

  ### Popular Operating Systems

- **Windows**  
  Developed by Microsoft, Windows is a widely employed operating system for personal computers, known for its user-friendly interface, extensive  
  software application support, and compatibility with diverse hardware configurations.

- **macOS**  
  Crafted by Apple, macOS functions as the operating system for Apple Mac computers, featuring an elegant and intuitive user interface, smooth  
  integration with other Apple devices, and a robust ecosystem of software applications.

- **Linux**  
  Linux, an open-source operating system, is highly customizable and extensively used in server environments and embedded systems. Recognized for its stability, security, and flexibility, Linux offers numerous distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS to meet varying user needs.

- **Unix**  
  Unix, a powerful multi-user operating system, serves as the foundation for many others, including Linux and macOS. Praised for its stability and security, Unix is particularly renowned for server applications.

- **Android**  
  Developed by Google, Android is an open-source operating system designed primarily for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It  
  provides a diverse ecosystem of applications and allows for significant customization.

- **iOS**  
  Another creation of Apple, iOS operates as the operating system for iPhones, iPads, and iPods. Offering a seamless and secure user experience,  
  iOS prioritizes performance and integrates smoothly with other Apple devices.
