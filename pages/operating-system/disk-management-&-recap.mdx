# Disk Management

Disk management is a critical aspect of operating systems that involves efficient handling and organization of disk storage resources.  
It encompasses various tasks, including disk partitioning, formatting, and implementing disk scheduling algorithms to optimize Input/Output (I/O) operations.

## Disk Scheduling Algorithms

Disk scheduling algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing disk I/O request processing and enhancing overall disk performance.  
Here are some notable disk scheduling algorithms:

### FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)

- **Description**: Processes disk requests in the order they arrive.  
- **Consideration**: Does not account for disk head position or request proximity, potentially causing delays with long seek times.

### SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

- **Description**: Chooses the request with the shortest seek time from the current disk head position.  
- **Advantage**: Minimizes average seek time, improving overall disk access time.  
- **Drawback**: May result in starvation for requests located farther away from the current position.

### SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)

- **Description**: Moves the disk head in one direction, servicing requests along the way, then changes direction upon reaching the end.  
- **Advantage**: Provides fair service distribution, prevents starvation.  
- **Drawback**: Longer response times for requests at far ends of the disk.

### C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)

- **Description**: Similar to SCAN but jumps to the other end of the disk without reversing direction.  
- **Advantage**: Consistent response time for all requests.  
- **Drawback**: May cause delays for requests arriving after the head has passed their location.

### LOOK

- **Description**: A variant of SCAN that only goes as far as the last request in its current direction, then reverses direction.  
- **Advantage**: Reduces unnecessary traversal of the entire disk, improving response times.

### C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)

- **Description**: Similar to C-SCAN, jumps to the other end of the disk without servicing requests along the way.  
- **Advantage**: Reduces seek time and improves disk throughput.

> Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on specific system requirements and characteristics.
