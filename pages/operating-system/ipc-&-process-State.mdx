### Interprocess Communication (IPC)

**Interprocess Communication (IPC)** serves as a communication bridge in a computer system, enabling different processes or threads to exchange  
information through shared resources like memory. It acts as an approved channel facilitated by the operating system, allowing processes to communicate and share data.

### Process States in OS

A **process state** is a program in execution and it is more than a program code called as the **text section**. This concept works under all the operating systems because all the tasks performed by the operating system need a process to execute them.

The process executes when it changes its state. The **state of a process** is defined by the current activity of the process.
