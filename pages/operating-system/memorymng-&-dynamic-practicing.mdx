### Memory Management

Memory Management in an operating system involves organizing and optimizing the use of a computer's memory. It includes allocating memory to different processes, ensuring they don't interfere with each other, and freeing up memory when it's no longer needed.

### Partition and Memory Allocation

Let's talk about two ways of handling memory in computer systems:

- **Fixed Partitioning**
- **Dynamic Partitioning**

#### Fixed Partitioning

In fixed partitioning, the computer's memory is divided into fixed-sized sections, and each section is assigned to a specific task or process. Each section has a set amount of memory, and this allocation remains the same throughout the process's execution.

-  Simple to implement  
-  Can lead to **internal fragmentation**

#### Dynamic Partitioning

Also called **variable partitioning**, dynamic partitioning improves on fixed partitioning by allowing the system to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically based on actual process needs.

-  Better memory utilization  
-  More complex to manage

**Memory Allocation Algorithms:**

- **First Fit:** Allocates the first block large enough for a process. Fast but may cause fragmentation.
- **Best Fit:** Allocates the smallest suitable block. Reduces wasted space but may be slower.
- **Worst Fit:** Allocates the largest block. Keeps larger blocks available for big processes.

Each comes with trade-offs in speed, efficiency, and memory fragmentation.
