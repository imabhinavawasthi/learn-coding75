## CSS Box Model

All HTML elements can be considered as **boxes**.

### The CSS Box Model

In CSS, the term **"box model"** is used when talking about **design and layout**.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element.  
It consists of the following parts:

1. **Content** – The actual content of the box (e.g., text, image)
2. **Padding** – Clears an area around the content (inside the border)
3. **Border** – A border that wraps around the padding and content
4. **Margin** – Clears an area outside the border (creates space between elements)

### Explanation of the Different Parts

- **Content** – The content of the box, where text and images appear
- **Padding** – Clears an area around the content. The padding is **transparent**
- **Border** – A border that goes around the padding and content
- **Margin** – Clears an area outside the border. The margin is **transparent**

The **box model** allows us to:

- Add a **border** around elements
- Define **space between elements**
### Example

Demonstration of the **box model**:

```css
div {
  width: 300px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}
```
### Width and Height of an Element

In order to set the `width` and `height` of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to understand how the **CSS Box Model** works.

> **Important:**  
> When you set the `width` and `height` properties of an element with CSS, you are only setting the size of the **content area**.

To calculate the **total width and height** of an element, you must also include:

- **Padding**
- **Borders**

This is crucial when designing layouts to ensure elements fit as expected.
