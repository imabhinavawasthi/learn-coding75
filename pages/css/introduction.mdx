# CSS Introduction

CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

## What is CSS?

- **CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**
- It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work â€” it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in `.css` files

## Why Use CSS?

CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

## CSS Example

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

## CSS Solved a Big Problem

HTML was **never** intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
