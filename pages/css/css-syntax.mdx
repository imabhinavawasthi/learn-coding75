## CSS Syntax

A CSS rule consists of a **selector** and a **declaration block**.

---

### CSS Selector

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

---

### Declaration Block

- The declaration block contains one or more declarations, separated by semicolons.
- Each declaration includes a **CSS property name** and a **value**, separated by a colon.
- Multiple declarations are separated with semicolons `;`, and the entire block is wrapped in curly braces `{}`.

### Example

In this example, all `<p>` elements will be center-aligned with red text color:

```css
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
```
## Example Explained

- `p` is a **selector** in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: `<p>`).
- `color` is a **property**, and `red` is the **property value**.
- `text-align` is a **property**, and `center` is the **property value**.
