# CSS Layout - The `position` Property

The `position` property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element. The five possible values for `position` are:

- `static`
- `relative`
- `fixed`
- `absolute`
- `sticky`

---

## `position: static;`

HTML elements are positioned **static** by default. 

- Static-positioned elements are not affected by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties.  
- They are always positioned according to the **normal flow** of the page.

### Example of `position: static;`

```css
div.static {
  position: static;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
```

# CSS Layout - `position: relative;`

An element with `position: relative;` is positioned **relative to its normal position** in the document flow.

- Setting the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties on a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted **away from its normal position**.
- **Other content** will **not** be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

### Example of `position: relative;`

```css
div.relative {
  position: relative;
  left: 30px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
```

# CSS Layout - `position: fixed;`

An element with `position: fixed;` is positioned **relative to the viewport**, meaning it will **stay in the same place** even when the page is scrolled. 

- The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties are used to position the element.
- A **fixed element** does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

### Example of `position: fixed;`

```css
div.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
```
