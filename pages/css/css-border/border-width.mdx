# CSS Border Width

The **border-width** property specifies the width of the four borders.

The width can be set as a specific size (in `px`, `pt`, `cm`, `em`, etc.) or by using one of the three pre-defined values:

- **thin**: Defines a thin border width.
- **medium**: Defines a medium border width.
- **thick**: Defines a thick border width.

### Example:

```css
div.thin {
  border-width: thin;
}

div.medium {
  border-width: medium;
}

div.thick {
  border-width: thick;
}

div.custom {
  border-width: 5px;
}
```

# CSS Specific Side Widths

The **border-width** property can have from one to four values, which specify the width of the borders for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

- **One value**: Applies the same width to all four sides.
- **Two values**: The first value is for the top and bottom, and the second is for the left and right.
- **Three values**: The first value is for the top, the second for the left and right, and the third for the bottom.
- **Four values**: Each value corresponds to one side (top, right, bottom, and left).

### Example: Specific Side Widths

```html
<p className="one">All sides have the same width.</p>
<p className="two">Top and bottom have the same width, left and right have the same width.</p>
<p className="three">Top has a different width, left and right have the same width, bottom has a different width.</p>
<p className="four">Each side has a different width.</p>
