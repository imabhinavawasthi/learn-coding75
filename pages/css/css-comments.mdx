# CSS Comments

**CSS comments** are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.

### CSS Comments

Comments are used to explain the code and may help when you edit the source code at a later date. They are ignored by browsers.

A **CSS comment** is placed inside the `<style>` element, and starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`:

### Example:

```css
/* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red;
}
```

# CSS Comments Placement

You can add comments wherever you want in the code:

### Example:

```css
p {
  color: red;  /* Set text color to red */
}
