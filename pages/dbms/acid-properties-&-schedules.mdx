# ACID Properties

The properties that ensure the **consistency**, **reliability**, and **correctness** of transactions in a database system are known as the **ACID** properties. ACID stands for:

### 1. Atomicity
Ensures that a transaction is treated as a **single unit of work**, meaning that either **all operations succeed** or **none do**.  
If any part of the transaction fails, the **entire transaction is rolled back**, returning the database to its original state.

### 2. Consistency
Ensures that the **database remains in a consistent state** before and after the execution of a transaction.  
All **constraints and rules** defined on the database schema must be enforced throughout the transaction.

### 3. Isolation
Ensures that transactions execute **independently of one another**.  
Each transaction operates as if it were the **only transaction** executing, even when multiple transactions are running concurrently.

### 4. Durability
Ensures that the **effects of a committed transaction are permanent**, even in the event of system failures.  
Once committed, the transactionâ€™s changes are **saved to the database permanently**.

# Schedules in DBMS

A **schedule** is the sequential order in which operations of multiple transactions are executed.  
It represents the **timeline of operations** and helps manage concurrent transactions effectively.

### 1. Serial Schedule
- Transactions execute **one after another**, in sequence.
- **Only one transaction executes at any given time**.
- Guarantees:
  - Consistency  
  - Recoverability  
  - Cascadelessness  
  - Strictness

### 2. Non-Serial Schedule
- **Multiple transactions execute simultaneously**.
- Operations from different transactions are **interleaved**.
- Allows for **parallel execution** but may **not guarantee** consistency, recoverability, cascadelessness, and strictness.
