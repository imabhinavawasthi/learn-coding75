# Serializability

**Serializability** is a concept used to determine the correctness of **non-serial schedules** and ensure **database consistency**. It identifies which concurrent schedules are valid and preserve the integrity of the database.

## 1. Serializable Schedules

A **non-serial schedule** involving 'n' transactions is **serializable** if it is **equivalent to some serial schedule** of the same 'n' transactions.  
Serializable schedules maintain:
- Consistency  
- Recoverability  
- Cascadelessness  
- Strictness

### Types of Serializable Schedules

#### Conflict Serializable
A non-serial schedule that can be transformed into a serial schedule by **swapping non-conflicting operations**.

#### View Serializable
A schedule is **view serializable** if it is **view equivalent** to a serial schedule, i.e., it results in the **same final state** and **reads the same data values**.

## 2. Non-Serializable Schedules

Schedules that **cannot be transformed into a serial schedule**. These may or may not be:
- Consistent  
- Recoverable

### Irrecoverable Schedules
If a transaction **reads data modified by another uncommitted transaction** and commits **before** the other transaction commits, it's called an **Irrecoverable Schedule**.

### Recoverable Schedules
If a transaction **delays its commit** until the transaction from which it read uncommitted data either **commits or rolls back**, it's called a **Recoverable Schedule**.

### Types of Recoverable Schedules

#### 1. Cascading Schedule (Cascading Rollback / Cascading Abort)
Occurs when the **failure of one transaction leads to rollback of several dependent transactions**.

#### 2. Cascadeless Schedule
Prevents cascading rollbacks by **disallowing reads from uncommitted transactions**.

#### 3. Strict Schedule
A stricter form of cascadeless schedules â€” **no transaction is allowed to read or write a data item until the last transaction that wrote it is committed or aborted**.
