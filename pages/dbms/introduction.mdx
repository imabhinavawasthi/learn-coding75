# Introduction to Database Management System

Before we dive into core concepts, let us see the basic terminologies:

## What is Data?

Data encompasses raw, unstructured information such as text, observations, figures, symbols, and descriptions, lacking inherent purpose or significance. It is quantified in bits and bytes, fundamental units in computer storage and processing. Recorded data remains devoid of meaning until processed.

There are two types of data:
- **Quantitative data**
- **Qualitative data**

**Quantitative data** is expressed numerically, such as in measurements of weight, volume, or cost.  
**Qualitative data**, on the other hand, is descriptive rather than numerical, including attributes like names, gender, or hair color.

## What is Information?

Information refers to organized data that provides meaningful insights or knowledge.  

For example, a weather forecast predicting rain tomorrow is information derived from data collected by meteorological instruments.  
Similarly, a report detailing quarterly sales figures provides information distilled from transaction records.

## Difference Between Data and Information

| Aspect         | Data                                                                 | Information                                                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Nature**     | Raw, unprocessed facts                                               | Processed, organized, and contextualized data                                 |
| **Context**    | Lacks context and interpretation                                     | Contextualized and interpreted to provide insights                            |
| **Purpose**    | Does not serve a specific purpose on its own                         | Intended to inform, guide decision-making, or provide understanding           |
| **Representation** | Text, numbers, or symbols                                       | Structured formats like reports, charts, or graphs                            |
| **Actionability** | May not be actionable without further processing                 | Often actionable, guiding decisions or prompting actions                      |
