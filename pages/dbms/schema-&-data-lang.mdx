# What is Schema and Instances?

The comprehensive design of the database is referred to as the **database schema**.  
A schema serves as a structural description of data, typically remaining unchanged, while the data it describes may undergo frequent modifications.

### Types of Schemas:
- **Physical Schema**  
- **Logical Schema**  
- **View Schema** (also called **Subschemas**)

In DBMS, an **instance** refers to a snapshot or representation of the database at a specific moment in time.  
It includes all the data currently stored in the database, along with the current state of any database structures, such as **indexes** or **constraints**.  
An instance provides a view of the database as it exists at a particular point, capturing the data and structure at that moment.

# Data Models

A **data model** is a conceptual framework for organizing and representing data in a database.  
It defines the structure, relationships, constraints, and operations associated with the data.  
There are several types of data models:

---

### 1. Entity-Relationship Model

Represents data as **entities** (objects), their **attributes**, and the **relationships** between entities.  
It is often used for designing databases before implementation in relational or other data models.

---

### 2. Relational Data Model

Represents data as **tables** with **rows** and **columns**, emphasizing relationships between tables.  
It is widely used in modern database systems, with **SQL** being the standard language for data manipulation.

---

### 3. Object-Oriented Data Model

Treats data as **objects**, similar to object-oriented programming languages.  
It supports **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**, providing more flexibility in representing complex data structures.

# Data Languages

## 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

Used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and schemas.  
**DDL commands** include:
- **CREATE**  
- **ALTER**  
- **DROP**  
- **TRUNCATE**  

These commands allow users to create new database objects, modify existing ones, or remove them entirely.

---

## 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Used to manipulate data within the database.  
**DML commands** include:
- **SELECT**  
- **INSERT**  
- **UPDATE**  
- **DELETE**  

These commands enable users to retrieve, insert, modify, and delete data in database tables.

---

## 3. Data Control Language (DCL)

Used to control access to data within the database.  
**DCL commands** include:
- **GRANT**  
- **REVOKE**  

These commands allow users to grant or revoke permissions on database objects such as tables, views, and procedures.

---

## 4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)

Used to manage transactions within the database.  
**TCL commands** include:
- **COMMIT**  
- **ROLLBACK**  
- **SAVEPOINT**  

These commands enable users to control the outcome and integrity of transactions.
