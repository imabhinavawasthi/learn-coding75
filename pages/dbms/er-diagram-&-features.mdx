# Entity-Relationship Diagram

An **ER diagram**, or **Entity Relationship diagram**, provides a visual depiction of the logical structure of a database.  
- It illustrates the **constraints** and **relationships** between various components.  
- An ER diagram typically consists of three primary components: **Entity Sets**, **Attributes**, and **Relationship Sets**.

**Stud_id**, **Col_id** is the primary key.  
**Student**, **College** are entity sets of which (Stud_id, Stud name, Stud addr) and (Col_id, Col name) are attributes of respectively.  
**Study In** is the relationship between **Student** and **College** entities.

### Entity Set

It is a set of the same type of entities.  
1. **Strong Entity Set**: In a strong entity set, the primary key exists. A primary key in an entity set is represented by underlining it.  
2. **Weak Entity Set**: No primary key exists. It contains a partial key called **discriminator**.

---

### Relationship

An association among entities.  
It can be **unary**, **binary**, **ternary**, or **n-ary**.

---

### Cardinality Constraint

Maximum number of relationship instances an entity set can take part in.  
It can be:  
- **One-to-one**
- **One-to-many**
- **Many-to-one**
- **Many-to-many**

### Attributes

Attributes are the descriptive characteristics possessed by each entity within an Entity Set.

#### Types of Attributes:
1. **Simple Attribute**: A single atomic value is associated with each instance of the attribute. For example, **"Age"** or **"Name"**.
2. **Composite Attribute**: It comprises multiple simple attributes. For instance, an **"Address"** attribute may include **"Street"**, **"City"**, and **"Zip Code"** components.
3. **Derived Attribute**: This attribute's value is derived or calculated from other attributes. For example, **"Age"** can be derived from the **"Date of Birth"**.
4. **Single-valued Attribute**: It holds a single value for each instance of the entity. For instance, **"Height"** or **"Weight"**.
5. **Multi-valued Attribute**: It can hold multiple values for each instance of the entity. For example, **"Phone Numbers"** or **"Skills"**.
6. **Key Attribute**: It uniquely identifies each entity within an entity set. For example, **"ID"** or **"Employee Number"**.

# Extended ER Features

**Extended Entity-Relationship (EER)** features in database management systems (DBMS) extend the capabilities of traditional **Entity-Relationship (ER)** models.  
These features include:

1. **Generalization**: Aggregates common attributes and relationships from multiple entities to form a **supertype**.
2. **Specialization**: The process of defining subtypes based on a subset of attributes and relationships from a supertype.
3. **Aggregation**: EER models allow entities and relationships to be aggregated into higher-level constructs known as **aggregates**.  
This enables the modeling of complex relationships between groups of entities or relationships.
