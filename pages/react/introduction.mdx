# React Introduction

ReactJS is a **component-based** JavaScript library used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It simplifies the creation of **single-page applications (SPAs)** with a focus on performance and maintainability.

## Key Points

- Developed and maintained by **Facebook**  
- The latest version of React is **React 19**
- Uses a **virtual DOM** for faster updates
- Supports a **declarative approach** to designing UI components
- Ensures better application control with **one-way data binding**

## “Hello, World!” Program in React

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
