# React JSX

## What is JSX?

**JSX** stands for **JavaScript XML**. It allows us to write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript, which makes it easier to define the structure of UI elements in React.

JSX simplifies the process of adding HTML elements in React and is commonly used in React code.

---

## Coding JSX

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them directly in the DOM without needing to use methods like `createElement()` or `appendChild()`.

When you write JSX, it gets converted into **React elements**, which React can then render to the DOM.

Although itâ€™s not required to use JSX in React, it **makes it easier** and cleaner to write React applications.

## Example 1: Using JSX

```js
const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);
```

## JSX Expressions

As you saw in the first example, JSX allows us to write **HTML directly** within JavaScript code. 

JSX is an **extension of the JavaScript language** based on ES6 syntax and is **converted into regular JavaScript** during runtime.

---

## Expressions in JSX

In JSX, you can write **expressions** inside curly braces `{ }`. 

These expressions can be:

- React variables or properties
- Any valid JavaScript expression

JSX will evaluate the expression and render the result.

---

## Example

Execute the expression `5 + 5` within JSX:

```js
const myElement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX</h1>;
```

## Inserting a Large Block of HTML

When you need to write HTML that spans multiple lines, wrap the HTML inside **parentheses**. This helps to keep the code clean and properly formatted.

---

## Example

Create a list with three list items:

```js
const myElement = (
  <ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Bananas</li>
    <li>Cherries</li>
  </ul>
);
```
