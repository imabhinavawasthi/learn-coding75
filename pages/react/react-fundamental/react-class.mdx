## React Class Components

Before React 16.8, **Class components** were the only way to track state and lifecycle in a React component.  
Function components were considered "**state-less**".

With the addition of **Hooks**, Function components are now almost equivalent to Class components.  
The differences are so minor that you will probably **never need to use a Class component** in React.

Even though Function components are preferred, there are **no current plans to remove Class components** from React.

This section will give you an overview of how to use **Class components** in React.

>  *Feel free to skip this section, and use Function Components instead.*

## React Components

Components are **independent** and **reusable** bits of code.  
They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in **isolation** and return HTML via a `render()` function.

Components come in two types: **Class components** and **Function components**.  
In this chapter, you will learn about **Class components**.

### Create a Class Component

When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an **upper case** letter.

The component has to include the `extends React.Component` statement.  
This statement creates an inheritance to `React.Component` and gives your component access to React's component functions.

The component also requires a `render()` method. This method returns HTML.

#### Example

**Create a Class component called `Car`:**

```jsx
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```

## Component Constructor

If there is a `constructor()` function in your component, this function will be called when the component gets **initiated**.

The `constructor` function is where you **initiate the component's properties**.

In React, component properties should be kept in an object called `state`.

> ðŸ’¡ You will learn more about `state` later in this tutorial.

The `constructor` function is also where you honor the inheritance of the parent component by including the `super()` statement.  
This executes the parent component's constructor function and allows your component to access all the functions of the parent (`React.Component`).

### Example 1

**Create a constructor function in the `Car` component and add a `color` property:**

```jsx
class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { color: "red" };
  }

  render() {
    return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```
