# React Render HTML

React's primary goal is to **render HTML** inside a web page dynamically.

This is done using the `createRoot()` function and its method `render()` from the `react-dom/client` package.

---

## The `createRoot()` Function

The `createRoot()` function takes **one argument**, an HTML element from the DOM.

Its purpose is to **specify the HTML element** where your React components should be rendered.

---

## The `render()` Method

Once the root is created, the `render()` method is used to display the desired React content **inside the specified HTML element**.

---

## But Render Where?

In a React project, there is a folder named **`public`**. Inside that, you'll find an `index.html` file.

Within the `<body>` tag of `index.html`, there's usually a single empty element like this:

```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
```
## Example

**Display a paragraph inside an element with the id of `"root"`:**

```js
const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<p>Hello</p>);
```
