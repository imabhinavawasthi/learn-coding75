# React Getting Started

To use React in production, you need **npm**, which comes bundled with **Node.js**.

However, to quickly understand what React is and how it works, you can start writing React code **directly in HTML files** without any complex setup.

---

## React Directly in HTML

The quickest way to start learning React is to embed it directly in your HTML files. This is perfect for beginners or small experiments.

---

## How to Use React in HTML

Start by including the following three scripts in your HTML file:

1. **React**  
2. **ReactDOM**  
3. **Babel** — allows you to use JSX and modern JavaScript features in older browsers.

> You will learn more about JSX in the **React JSX** chapter.

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>React in HTML</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <script type="text/babel">
      function App() {
        return <h1>Hello from React!</h1>;
      }

      ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```


# What's Next?

Now that you have a React environment set up on your computer, you're ready to dive deeper into learning React!

In the rest of this tutorial, we will use our **"Show React"** tool to demonstrate various React concepts and how they are rendered in the browser.

## Try It on Your Own Computer

If you'd like to follow along with the examples on your machine:

- Start by **cleaning the `src` folder** of your React app.
- Keep only a single file: `index.js`.
- Remove any extra or unnecessary lines from `index.js` to match the example below.

---

## Example

Click the **"Run Example"** button (if using the online tool) to see the result.

Here’s the content of a simplified `index.js` file:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const myFirstElement = <h1>Hello React!</h1>;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myFirstElement);
