# React Components

Components are like functions that return HTML elements.

## React Components Overview

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Components come in two types:

- **Class Components**
- **Function Components**

In this tutorial, we will concentrate on **Function components**.

>  In older React code bases, you may find Class components primarily used.  
> It is now suggested to use Function components along with **Hooks**, which were added in React 16.8.  
> There is an optional section on Class components for your reference.

## Create Your First Component

When creating a React component, the component's name **MUST** start with an upper case letter.

### Class Component

A class component must include the `extends React.Component` statement.  
This statement creates an inheritance to `React.Component`, and gives your component access to `React.Component`'s functions.

The component also requires a `render()` method. This method returns HTML.

#### Example

**Create a Class component called `Car`:**

```jsx
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```

## Function Component

Here is the same example as above, but created using a **Function component** instead.

A Function component also returns HTML and behaves much the same way as a Class component.  
However, Function components can be written using **much less code**, are **easier to understand**, and will be **preferred** in this tutorial.

#### Example

**Create a Function component called `Car`:**

```jsx
function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}
```

## Rendering a Component

Now your React application has a component called `Car`, which returns an `<h2>` element.

To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as normal HTML: `<Car />`

#### Example

**Display the `Car` component in the "root" element:**

```jsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);
```
