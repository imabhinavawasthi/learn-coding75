## React Router

**Create React App** doesn't include page routing.

**React Router** is the most popular solution.

### Add React Router

To add React Router in your application, run this in the terminal from the **root directory** of the application:

```bash
npm i -D react-router-dom

Note: This tutorial uses React Router v6.
If you are upgrading from v5, you will need to use the @latest flag:

npm i -D react-router-dom@latest

```

## Folder Structure

To create an application with multiple page routes, let's first start with the file structure.

Within the `src` folder, we'll create a folder named **pages** with several files:


src\pages:

Layout.js  Home.js  Blogs.js  Contact.js  NoPage.js

## Example: Use React Router to route to pages based on URL

In your `index.js` file:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Layout from "./pages/Layout";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import Blogs from "./pages/Blogs";
import Contact from "./pages/Contact";
import NoPage from "./pages/NoPage";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="blogs" element={<Blogs />} />
          <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
          <Route path="*" element={<NoPage />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```
