# `useRoutes` Hook in React Router

React Router is a library used for handling **navigation and routing** in React applications. It allows seamless navigation between components or pages while keeping a **Single Page Application (SPA)** structure.

---

## What is `useRoutes` Hook?

The `useRoutes` Hook is a part of **React Router v6**. It allows you to **define and configure routes declaratively** using JavaScript objects instead of JSX.

It is the **functional equivalent** of the `<Routes>` component.

### Key Benefits

- Declarative route configuration
- Programmatic flexibility
- Ideal for dynamic or nested routing setups

## Syntax

```js
const element = useRoutes(routes);
```
# Example: Using `useRoutes` in React Router v6

Below is a basic example demonstrating how to use the `useRoutes` Hook from `react-router-dom` to define application routes in a declarative way.

---

## Code Example

```jsx
import { useRoutes, BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

const AppRoutes = () => {
  const routes = [
    { path: "/", element: <Home /> },
    { path: "/about", element: <About /> },
    {
      path: "/dashboard",
      element: <Dashboard />,
      children: [
        { path: "stats", element: <Stats /> },
        { path: "profile", element: <Profile /> }
      ]
    }
  ];

  const routing = useRoutes(routes);
  return routing;
};

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <AppRoutes />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

# Features and Uses of `useRoutes` Hook

The `useRoutes` Hook from React Router v6 allows developers to define routes using a **configuration object**, offering a more programmatic and flexible way to manage routing in React applications.

---

##  Features of `useRoutes`

- **Declarative Route Definition**  
  Define routes using a configuration JavaScript object instead of JSX.

- **Nested Routing**  
  Easily create **nested routes** for sections like dashboards or layouts.

- **Dynamic Parameters**  
  Supports parameters like `/product/:id` for dynamic route matching.

- **Wildcard Support**  
  Use `*` for **catch-all routes** (e.g., handling 404 pages).

##  Uses of `useRoutes` Hook

### 1. Making Routes Flexible

Allows you to change routes **dynamically** based on application state or data. For example:

```js
const routes = user.isLoggedIn
  ? [{ path: "/dashboard", element: <Dashboard /> }]
  : [{ path: "/login", element: <Login /> }];
```
