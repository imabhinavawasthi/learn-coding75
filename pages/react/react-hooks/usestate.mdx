## React useState Hook

The React **useState** Hook allows us to track state in a function component.

State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracked in an application.

---

### Import useState

To use the `useState` Hook, we first need to import it into our component.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
```

## Initialize useState

We initialize our state by calling `useState` in our function component.

`useState` accepts an initial state and returns two values:

- The **current state**.
- A **function** that updates the state.

---

### Example: Initialize state

Initialize state at the top of the function component.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("");
}
```
## Destructuring useState

Notice that again, we are destructuring the returned values from `useState`.

- The first value, `color`, is our **current state**.
- The second value, `setColor`, is the **function** that is used to update our state.

These names are variables that can be named anything you would like.

Lastly, we set the initial state to an empty string: `useState("")`

## Read State

We can now include our state anywhere in our component.

---

### Example: Use State in Render

Use the state variable in the rendered component.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<FavoriteColor />);
```
## Update State

To update our state, we use our state updater function.

We should **never** directly update state. For example: `color = "red"` is not allowed.

---

### Example: Use Button to Update State

Use a button to update the state:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setColor("blue")}
      >Blue</button>
    </>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<FavoriteColor />);
```
