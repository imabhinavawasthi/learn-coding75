# React `useCallback` Hook

The `useCallback` Hook is a built-in React Hook that **memoizes a callback function**, preventing it from being recreated on every render unless its dependencies change.

This is particularly useful for **performance optimization**, especially when you're passing functions as props to child components — helping avoid unnecessary re-renders.

---

##  Syntax

```js
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // Function logic
}, [dependencies]);
```

##  Key Points

- The function to be memoized is passed as the **first argument**.
- An array of **dependencies** is passed as the **second argument** — the callback is only recreated when these change.

---

##  Why `useCallback` Matters

Without `useCallback`, a **new instance** of the function is created on **every render**, which can result in:

-  **Unnecessary re-renders** of child components
-  **Performance degradation** in large or deeply nested components

With `useCallback`:

- The function is **memoized**
- It only **updates when dependencies change**
- React can **skip re-renders**, making your app smoother and more efficient

>  Use `useCallback` when passing functions as props to optimize rendering performance.

##  Without the `useCallback` Hook

This example demonstrates a **counter app** built **without using** the `useCallback` Hook.

Each time the component re-renders, **new instances** of the functions are created, causing the `Set` to grow — proving that the functions aren't memoized.

---

###  Code Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const funcSet = new Set();

const App = () => {
  const [cnt, setCnt] = useState(0);
  const [num, setNum] = useState(0);

  const incCnt = () => setCnt(cnt + 1);
  const decCnt = () => setCnt(cnt - 1);
  const incNum = () => setNum(num + 1);

  funcSet.add(incCnt);
  funcSet.add(decCnt);
  funcSet.add(incNum);
  alert(funcSet.size); // Alerts growing size due to new function instances

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Without useCallback Hook</h2>
      <button onClick={incCnt}>Increase Counter</button>
      <button onClick={decCnt}>Decrease Counter</button>
      <button onClick={incNum}>Increase Number</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
###  In This Example

- `useState` manages `cnt` and `num` states.
- Functions (`incCnt`, `decCnt`, `incNum`) are used to update these states.
- Functions are stored in a `Set`, which only keeps **unique values**.
- Clicking a button updates the state and triggers an **alert** showing the current count of unique function references.

---

###  The Problem

Every time the component re-renders:

- **New function references** are created.
- The `Set` keeps adding them because it sees them as **new objects**.
- This leads to:
  -  **Unnecessary re-renders** of child components (if functions are passed as props)
  -  **Inefficient memory usage** as more and more function instances are stored

>  To solve this issue, we can use the `useCallback` Hook to **memoize** these functions and keep them stable across renders.

##  Using the `useCallback` Hook

To solve the problem of unnecessary re-renders and memory inefficiency, we can use the `useCallback` hook. It optimizes performance by memoizing the callback functions, ensuring that the functions are only recreated when their dependencies change.

---

###  Code Example

```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const funcSet = new Set();

const App = () => {
  const [cnt, setCnt] = useState(0);
  const [num, setNum] = useState(0);

  const incCnt = useCallback(() => setCnt(cnt + 1), [cnt]);
  const decCnt = useCallback(() => setCnt(cnt - 1), [cnt]);
  const incNum = useCallback(() => setNum(num + 1), [num]);

  funcSet.add(incCnt);
  funcSet.add(decCnt);
  funcSet.add(incNum);
  alert(funcSet.size); // Alerts 3 — function references are stable

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>With useCallback Hook</h2>
      <button onClick={incCnt}>Increase Counter</button>
      <button onClick={decCnt}>Decrease Counter</button>
      <button onClick={incNum}>Increase Number</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
###  In This Example

- `useState` manages the `cnt` and `num` states.
- `useCallback` memoizes `incCnt`, `decCnt`, and `incNum` to **prevent unnecessary function re-creations**.
- Each function updates `cnt` and `num` when called.
- The `funcSet` keeps track of **unique function references**.
- Clicking a button updates the corresponding state and triggers an **alert** showing the current count of unique function references.

> Using `useCallback` ensures that the same function references are used on each render, improving performance and memory efficiency.


##  When to Use `useCallback`?

You should use the `useCallback` Hook in the following scenarios:

- **Passing Functions as Props**: To prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that rely on stable function references.
- **Avoiding Unnecessary Function Re-creations**: Inside `useEffect` or event handlers, where functions would be re-created on each render.
- **Ensuring Stable Function References**: To ensure a function reference does not change across renders unless its dependencies change.

###  Caution: Avoid Overusing `useCallback`

While `useCallback` can optimize performance, it can also add unnecessary complexity and lead to **premature optimization**. Only use it when you notice performance issues caused by function re-creations.

### When to Use:

- Use **`useCallback`** for stable function references, especially when passing functions to child components.
- Use **`useMemo`** for optimizing expensive calculations or values that do not need to be recalculated on each render.

>  **In short**: Use `useCallback` for **functions** and `useMemo` for **values**.
