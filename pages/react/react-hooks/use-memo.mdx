# ReactJS `useMemo` Hook


The `useMemo` Hook is a built-in React Hook that helps **optimize performance** by **memoizing** the result of a computation. It reuses the result unless its dependencies change, preventing expensive computations from being **re-executed unnecessarily** during component re-renders.

##  Syntax

```js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```
## 1. Optimizing Expensive Calculations

In this example, we have an expensive computation (squaring a number) that should not be recalculated on every render. We use the `useMemo` hook to memoize the result of the computation.

###  Code Example

```jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from "react";

function App() {
    const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);
    const squaredNum = useMemo(() => squareNum(number), [number]);
    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

    const onChangeHandler = (e) => {
        setNumber(e.target.value);
    };

    const counterHander = () => {
        setCounter(counter + 1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h1>Welcome to Geeksforgeeks</h1>
            <input
                type="number"
                placeholder="Enter a number"
                value={number}
                onChange={onChangeHandler}
            ></input>

            <div>OUTPUT: {squaredNum}</div>
            <button onClick={counterHander}>Counter ++</button>
            <div>Counter : {counter}</div>
        </div>
    );
}

function squareNum(number) {
    console.log("Squaring will be done!");
    return Math.pow(number, 2);
}

export default App;
```
##  When to Use `useMemo`?

You should use the `useMemo` Hook in the following scenarios:

- **Expensive Calculations**: When you have expensive computations that **do not need to be re-executed** unless certain dependencies change.
- **Large Data Sets**: When you're working with large data sets and want to **optimize performance** by preventing unnecessary recalculations.
- **Prevent Unnecessary Re-renders**: To prevent **unnecessary re-renders** of child components by ensuring stable references.

##  `useCallback` vs `useMemo`

Both `useCallback` and `useMemo` are **similar** but serve **different purposes**:

- **`useCallback`**: Memoizes a **function** and ensures its reference remains stable across renders.
- **`useMemo`**: Memoizes a **value** (often the result of an expensive calculation), caching the result to avoid unnecessary recomputations.
