The `Math` object in JavaScript provides a set of methods and properties for mathematical constants and functions. It is a built-in object that allows for performing mathematical operations and accessing mathematical constants without creating an instance.

## What is the Math Object?

The `Math` object is an inbuilt object that has attributes and methods for mathematical functions and constants. Itâ€™s not a function object. The `Math` object works with the `Number` type and does not have a constructor. All properties and methods of `Math` are fixed/static and can be called by using `Math` as an object without creating it.

For example, the cosine function is accessed using `Math.cos(y)`, and the constant pi is accessed using `Math.PI`.

In this article, we will discuss various available methods & properties used in JavaScript. We will start with the `Math` properties in JavaScript.

## Static Math Properties

The Math properties and their descriptions are listed below:

```js
console.log("Math.PI :" + Math.PI);
console.log("Math.SQRT2:" + Math.SQRT2);
console.log("Math.SQRT1_2:" + Math.SQRT1_2);
console.log("Math.LN10:" + Math.LN10);
console.log("Math.LN2:" + Math.LN2);
console.log("Math.LOG10E:" + Math.LOG10E);
console.log("Math.LOG2E:" + Math.LOG2E);
```

### Output:

```
Math.PI :3.141592653589793
Math.SQRT2:1.4142135623730951
Math.SQRT1_2:0.7071067811865476
Math.LN10:2.302585092994046
Math.LN2:0.6931471805599453
Math.LOG10E:0.4342944819032518
Math.LOG2E:1.44269504088...
```

## Math Methods

The methods associated with the `Math` object are listed below, along with their descriptions.

```js
console.log("ceil :" + Math.ceil(9.6));
console.log("floor :" + Math.floor(9.6));
console.log("round :" + Math.round(9.6));
console.log("sine :" + Math.sin(30));
console.log("cosine :" + Math.cos(30));
console.log("min :" + Math.min(30, 40));
console.log("max :" + Math.max(30, 40));
console.log("sign :" + Math.sign(-40));
console.log("abs :" + Math.abs(-40));
```

### Output:

```
ceil :10
floor :9
round :10
sine :-0.9880316240928618
cosine :0.15425144988758405
min :30
max :40
sign :-1
abs :40
```

## Common Use Cases of Math Object

The `Math` object is widely used in various scenarios such as:

- **Calculations**: Performing arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex calculations involving trigonometric functions.
- **Random Number Generation**: Generating random numbers for simulations, games, or random selections.

```js
const randomNumber = Math.random();
console.log("Random number:", randomNumber);
