## JavaScript Ternary Operator

The Ternary Operator in JavaScript is a shortcut for writing simple if-else statements. It’s also known as the Conditional Operator because it works based on a condition. The ternary operator allows you to quickly decide between two values depending on whether a condition is true or false.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// JavaScript to illustrate Conditional operator
let PMarks = 50;
let res = (PMarks > 39) ? "Pass" : "Fail";
console.log(res);`}
</CodeBlock>

**Output:**
```plaintext
Pass
```

### How Does the Ternary Operator Work?
The ternary operator works with three parts:
- **Condition**: A statement that returns true or false.
- **Value if True**: What happens if the condition is true?
- **Value if False**: What happens if the condition is false?

**Syntax:**
```javascript
condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression
```

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// JavaScript to illustrate Conditional operator
let age = 60;
let res = (age > 59) ? "Adult" : "Not Adult";
console.log(res);`}
</CodeBlock>

**Output:**
```plaintext
Adult
```

### Characteristics of Ternary Operator
- The expression consists of three operands: the condition, value if true, and value if false.
- The evaluation of the condition should result in either a true/false or a boolean value.
- The true value lies between `?` & `:` and is executed if the condition returns true. Similarly, the false value lies after `:` and is executed if the condition returns false.

### Nested Ternary Operators
The below code assigns a grade to marks using nested ternary operators. It checks ranges: `<40` as “Unsatisfactory”, `<60` as “Average”, `<80` as “Good”, and `>=80` as “Excellent”, then prints the result.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`// JavaScript to illustrate multiple Conditional operators
let marks = 95;
let res = (marks < 40) ? "Unsatisfactory" :
          (marks < 60) ? "Average" :
          (marks < 80) ? "Good" : "Excellent";
console.log(res);`}
</CodeBlock>

**Output:**
```plaintext
Excellent
```

### Alternate Implementation

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`let marks = 95;
let res = (marks > 80) ? 
          (marks > 90 ? "Excellent" : "Good") : 
          "Average";
console.log(res);`}
</CodeBlock>

**Output:**
```plaintext
Excellent
