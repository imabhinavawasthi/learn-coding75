# JavaScript `this` Keyword

The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the object to which it belongs. Its value is determined by how a function is called, making it a dynamic reference. The `this` keyword is a powerful and fundamental concept used to access properties and methods of an object, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.

## Example

```javascript
const person = {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    name: "Coding75",
=======
    name: "JavaScript Hub",
>>>>>>> 6c9caef (content Overview Complete)
    greet() {
        return `Welcome To, ${this.name}`;
    }
};
console.log(person.greet());
```

**Output:**
```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Welcome To, Coding75
=======
Welcome To, JavaScript Hub
>>>>>>> 6c9caef (content Overview Complete)
```

## Using `this` in a Method

In the context of an object method in JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the object itself, allowing access to its properties and methods within the methodâ€™s scope.

```javascript
const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    greet() {
        console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name + ' and I am ' + this.age + ' years old.');
    }
};

person.greet();
```

**Output:**
```text
Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

## Using `this` in a Function

In a JavaScript function, the behavior of the `this` keyword varies depending on how the function is invoked.

### Syntax:
```javascript
function exampleFunction() {
  console.log(this); // Refers to the current execution context
}
```

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
}

const person = {
    name: 'Amit',
    sayHello: greet
};
const anotherPerson = {
    name: 'Jatin'
};

person.sayHello();
greet.call(anotherPerson);
```

**Output:**
```text
Hello, my name is undefined
Hello, my name is Amit
Hello, my name is Jatin
```

## Using `this` Alone (Global Context)

When used alone in JavaScript, the behavior of the `this` keyword depends on whether the code is running in strict mode or not.

```javascript
console.log(this);
```

**Output:**
```text
{}
```

## Implicit Binding

When we call a function as a method of the object, the `this` keyword refers to the calling object.

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "Ram",
    age: 22,
    greet: function () {
        return `Hello ${this.name}, you are ${this.age} years old`;
    }
};
console.log(person.greet());
```

**Output:**
```text
Hello Ram, you are 22 years old
```

## Explicit Binding

When we explicitly bind the `this` keyword using the `call()`, `bind()`, or `apply()` method, the `this` reference changes to the object passed to these methods.

```javascript
function ageVerify() {
    console.log(this.age >= 18 ? "Yes you can drive" : "No you cannot drive");
}

const per1 = { age: 20 };
const per2 = { age: 16 };

ageVerify.call(per1);
ageVerify.call(per2);
```

**Output:**
```text
Yes you can drive
No you cannot drive
```

## Default Binding

When the `this` keyword is used in the global scope, it is set to the window object.

```javascript
const age = 22;
function verifyAge() {
    return this.age;
}
console.log(verifyAge());
```

**Output:**
```text
undefined
```

## Arrow Function Binding

When `this` is used in an arrow function, it has lexical scope, so it inherits `this` from its surrounding context.

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "ram",
    age: 22,
    greet: () => {
        return `Hello, you are ${this.age} years old`;
    }
};
console.log(person.greet());
```

**Output:**
```text
Hello, you are undefined years old
```

## Summary of `this` Keyword Behavior

- When used within a method of an object, `this` points to that object.
- When used by itself, `this` points to the global object.
- Within a function, `this` typically points to the global object.
- In a function under strict mode, `this` becomes `undefined`.
- During an event, `this` points to the element that triggered the event.
- Methods such as `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` can reassign `this` to any desired object.

### The Precedence Order of `this` Keyword
1. JavaScript `bind()` Method
2. JavaScript `call()` and `apply()` Method
3. JavaScript Object Method
4. JavaScript Global Scope

The `this` keyword in JavaScript dynamically refers to the object executing a function or method. Its context varies:
- In methods, it points to the object itself.
- In the global scope, it points to the global object (like `window`).
- In strict mode, it is `undefined`.
- It can be reassigned with `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()`.
