A Set in JavaScript is used to store a unique collection of items, meaning no duplicates are allowed.

Sets internally use a hash table which makes search, insert, and delete operations faster than arrays. Please note that a hash table data structure allows these operations to be performed on average in constant time.

- Set maintains insertion order. When we access items, we get them in the same order as inserted.
- Only Unique Keys are allowed. If we insert the same key with a different value, it overwrites the previous one.
- A Set can be created either empty or by providing an iterable like an array or string.

### Example Usage

```javascript
// using an array
let s1 = new Set([10, 30, 30, 40, 40]);
console.log(s1);
let s2 = new Set(["gfg", "gfg", "geeks"]);
console.log(s2);

// using string
let s3 = new Set("fooooooood");
console.log(s3);

// an empty set
let s4 = new Set();
console.log(s4);
```

#### Output
```javascript
Set(3) { 10, 30, 40 }
Set(2) { 'C75', 'Coding75' }
Set(3) { 'f', 'o', 'd' }
Set(0) {}
```

## Key Characteristics of Sets:

- **Unique Values**: A Set cannot contain duplicate values.
- **Ordered**: Sets maintain the insertion order of elements.
- **Iterable**: Sets can be iterated using loops or methods like `forEach`.
- **No Indexing**: Unlike arrays, Sets do not support indexing.

## Methods of Set in JavaScript

- `Set.add(value)`: Adds the new element with a specified value at the end of the Set object.
- `Set.delete(value)`: Deletes an element with the specified value from the Set object. 
- `Set.clear()`: Removes all the elements from the Set. 
- `Set.entries()`: Returns an iterator object which contains an array having the entries of the Set, in the insertion order. 
- `Set.has(value)`: Returns `true` if the specified value is present in the Set object. 
- `Set.values()`: Returns all the values from the Set in the same insertion order.
- `Set.keys()`: Also returns all the values from the Set in the insertion order. 
- `Set.forEach(callback)`: Executes the given function once for every element in the Set, in the insertion order.
- `Set.prototype[@@iterator]()` : Returns a Set iterator function, which is `values()` function by default.

## DSA Problems On Set In JavaScript

- **Union of Two Arrays**
- **Intersection of Two Arrays**
- **Distinct Elements in an Array**
- **Check for Disjoint Arrays or Sets**
- **Check if an Array is a Subset of Another**
- **Duplicate within K Distance in an Array**
- **2 Sum â€“ Check for Pair with Target Sum**
- **Only Repeating Element From 1 To n-1**
- **Longest Consecutive Sequence**
- **Smallest Subarray with k Distinct Numbers**
