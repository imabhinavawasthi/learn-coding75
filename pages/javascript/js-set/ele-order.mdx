In JavaScript, a new object called `Set` was introduced in the ES6 version. The `Set` object is similar to `Map`, but the major difference is that elements in the `Set` are unique, and repeated addition of the same type of elements is not possible. A `Set` can store any type of value, whether primitive or objects. The elements of a `Set` are iterable and always iterated in the insertion order.

## Ordered Elements in a Set

The elements of a `Set` are ordered, meaning they can be accessed or iterated in the order of their insertion.

### Syntax

```javascript
new Set([iterable]);
```

## Example 1: Basic Set Object Iteration

In this example, we create a basic `Set` object and iterate over its elements to see the order.

```javascript
let sample = new Set();
sample.add("Hello");
sample.add("Coders");
sample.add("How");
sample.add("Are");
sample.add("You");

let data = sample.values();
for (let val of data) {
    console.log(val);
}
```

### Output

```
Hello
Coders
How
Are
You
```

## Example 2: Using an Iterator to Access Set Elements

In this example, we use an iterator to access the elements of `Set` and verify the order of elements.

```javascript
let sample = new Set();
sample.add("Hello");
sample.add("Coders");
sample.add("How");
sample.add("Are");
sample.add("You");

let getit = sample[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(getit.next());
console.log(getit.next());
console.log(getit.next());
console.log(getit.next());
console.log(getit.next());
```

### Output

```
{value: 'Hello', done: false}
{value: 'Coders', done: false}
{value: 'How', done: false}
{value: 'Are', done: false}
{value: 'You', done: false}
```

### Explanation

We can easily verify that the elements in the `Set` follow the same order in which they are inserted.
