# JavaScript Object Reference

_Last Updated: 29 Aug, 2024_

In JavaScript, objects are a key data type and form the foundation of modern JavaScript. Unlike primitive types (like numbers or strings), objects can store collections of key-value pairs and complex data. You can create them using the Object() constructor or with curly braces {} called object literals.

## What are JavaScript Objects?
JavaScript objects are collections of properties, where each property is defined as a key-value pair. They are used to model real-world entities and complex data structures.

### Syntax:
Objects can be created using either the object literal syntax `{}` or the `Object()` constructor.

```javascript
objectName.methodName()
```

### Example: Using function definition as property value and accessing with additional details.

```javascript
// Object creation
let student = {
    name: "Martin",
    class: "12th",
    section: "A",

    studentDetails: function () {
        return this.name + " " + this.class
            + " " + this.section + " ";
    }
};

// Display object data
console.log("STUDENT " + student.studentDetails());
```

**Output:**
```
STUDENT Martin 12th A
