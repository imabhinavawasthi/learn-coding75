JavaScript is widely used in web development, and it supports some features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this article, we’ll explore these OOP features in JavaScript. We’ll also look at some common JavaScript OOP questions that are often asked in interviews.

- How is Object-Oriented Programming implemented in JavaScript? 
- How does it differ from other languages? 
- Can you implement Inheritance in JavaScript?

There are certain features or mechanisms which make a Language Object-Oriented like:

## OOPs Concept in JavaScript

- Object
- Classes
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Let’s dive into the details of each one of them and see how they are implemented in JavaScript.

### Object

An object is something that holds related data and actions. For example, a car can be an object — it has properties like color and model, and methods like drive. In JavaScript, objects are used everywhere. Things like arrays, functions, and even strings are all objects.

> **Note:** A Method in JavaScript is a property of an object whose value is a function.

The object can be created in two ways in JavaScript:

#### Object Literal

```js
// Defining object
let person = {
    first_name: 'Mukul',
    last_name: 'Latiyan',
    
    // Method
    getFunction: function () {
        return (`The name of the person is ${this.first_name} ${this.last_name}`);
    },
    
    // Object within object
    phone_number: {
        mobile: '12345',
        landline: '6789'
    }
};
console.log(person.getFunction());
console.log(person.phone_number.landline);
```

#### Object Constructor

```js
// Using a constructor
function Person(first_name, last_name) {
    this.first_name = first_name;
    this.last_name = last_name;
}

// Creating new instances of person object
let person1 = new Person('Mukul', 'Latiyan');
let person2 = new Person('Rahul', 'Avasthi');
 
console.log(person1.first_name);
console.log(`${person2.first_name} ${person2.last_name}`);
```

> **Note:** The JavaScript `Object.create()` method creates a new object using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.

```js
// Object.create() example
const coder = {
    isStudying: false,
    printIntroduction: function () {
        console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. Am I studying?: ${this.isStudying}.`);
    }
};

const me = Object.create(coder);
me.name = 'Mukul';
me.isStudying = true;
me.printIntroduction();
```

### Classes

Classes are blueprints of an Object. A class can have many Objects because the class is a template while Objects are instances of the class or the concrete implementation.

> **Note:** JavaScript is a prototype-based Object-Oriented Language, meaning it doesn’t have classes in the traditional sense but instead defines behaviors using constructor functions and prototypes.

```js
// Defining class using ES6
class Vehicle {
    constructor(name, maker, engine) {
        this.name = name;
        this.maker = maker;
        this.engine = engine;
    }
    getDetails() {
        return (`The name of the bike is ${this.name}.`);
    }
}

// Creating objects
let bike1 = new Vehicle('Hayabusa', 'Suzuki', '1340cc');
let bike2 = new Vehicle('Ninja', 'Kawasaki', '998cc');

console.log(bike1.name);
console.log(bike2.maker);
console.log(bike1.getDetails());
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping properties and functions within a single unit.

```js
// Encapsulation example
class Person {
    constructor(name, id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }
    add_Address(add) {
        this.add = add;
    }
    getDetails() {
        console.log(`Name is ${this.name}, Address is: ${this.add}`);
    }
}
 
let person1 = new Person('Mukul', 21);
person1.add_Address('Delhi');
person1.getDetails();
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a concept where some properties and methods of an Object are reused by another Object.

```js
// Inheritance example
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    toString() {
        return (`Name of person: ${this.name}`);
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    constructor(name, id) {
        super(name);
        this.id = id;
    }
    toString() {
        return (`${super.toString()}, Student ID: ${this.id}`);
    }
}

let student1 = new Student('Mukul', 22);
console.log(student1.toString());
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows a method in a child class to have the same name and signature as that of a parent class.

```js
class Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Animal speaks");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Dog barks");
    }
}
let pet = new Dog();
pet.speak();
```

JavaScript is best known for web page development but is also used in a variety of non-browser environments.
