# JavaScript JSON Objects

_Last Updated: 02 Dec, 2024_

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a handy way to share data. It’s easy for both people and computers to understand. In JavaScript, JSON helps organize data into simple objects. Let’s explore how JSON works and why it’s so useful for exchanging information.

```javascript
const jsonData = { 
    "key1" : "value1",
    // ...
};

const person = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
};
```

### Explanation:
- `{ }` – Curly braces define the object.
- `"name"`, `"age"`, `"city"` - These are the keys (properties) of the object. Keys are always strings.
- `"John"`, `30`, `"New York"` - These are the corresponding values associated with each key.
- `:` - Colon separates keys and values.
- `,` - Comma separates different key-value pairs within the object.

## Accessing JSON Object Values
The object values can be accessed by using the dot (`.`) notation. We can also access objects by using bracket (`[]`) notation.

```javascript
let myOrder, i;

// Object is created with name myOrder
myOrder = {
    "name_of_the_product": "Earbuds",
    "cost": "799",
    "warranty": "1 year "
};

// Accessing for particular detail from object myOrder
i = myOrder.name_of_the_product;

// It prints the detail of name of the product
console.log(i);
```

**Output:**
```
Earbuds
```

## Looping through JSON Object
Looping can be done in two ways:

1. Looping of an object can be done by using a property `for-in` loop.
2. For looping an object, we can even use brackets (`[]`) in the `for-in` loop property.

```javascript
let myOrder, a;

myOrder = {
    "name_of_product": "earbuds",
    "cost": "799",
    "warranty": "1 year"
};

for (a in myOrder) {
    // Accessing object in looping using bracket notation
    console.log(myOrder[a]);
}
```

**Output:**
```
earbuds
799
1 year
```

## Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object
To convert a JSON text to a JavaScript object, you can use the `JSON.parse()` method.

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name": "GFG", "age": 30}';
const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(jsonObject.name); 
console.log(jsonObject.age); 
```

**Output:**
```
GFG
30
