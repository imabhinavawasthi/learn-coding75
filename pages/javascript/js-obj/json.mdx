# JavaScript JSON Objects

_Last Updated: 02 Dec, 2024_

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It’s a simple way to store and share data. Both humans and computers can read it easily. In JavaScript, JSON is used to organize and exchange data in a clean and structured format.

```javascript
const jsonData = { 
    "key1" : "value1",
    // ...
};

const person = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
};
```

### Explanation:
- `{ }` – Curly braces define the object.
- `"name"`, `"age"`, `"city"` - These are the keys (properties) of the object. Keys are always strings.
- `"John"`, `30`, `"New York"` - These are the corresponding values associated with each key.
- `:` - Colon separates keys and values.
- `,` - Comma separates different key-value pairs within the object.

## Accessing JSON Object Values
The object values can be accessed by using the dot (`.`) notation. We can also access objects by using bracket (`[]`) notation.

```javascript
let myOrder, i;

// Object is created with name myOrder
myOrder = {
    "name_of_the_product": "Earbuds",
    "cost": "799",
    "warranty": "1 year "
};

// Accessing for particular detail from object myOrder
i = myOrder.name_of_the_product;

// It prints the detail of name of the product
console.log(i);
```

**Output:**
```
Earbuds
```

## Looping through JSON Object
Looping can be done in two ways:

1. Looping of an object can be done by using a property `for-in` loop.
2. For looping an object, we can even use brackets (`[]`) in the `for-in` loop property.

```javascript
let myOrder, a;

myOrder = {
    "name_of_product": "earbuds",
    "cost": "799",
    "warranty": "1 year"
};

for (a in myOrder) {
    // Accessing object in looping using bracket notation
    console.log(myOrder[a]);
}
```

**Output:**
```
earbuds
799
1 year
```

## Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object
To convert a JSON text to a JavaScript object, you can use the `JSON.parse()` method.

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
const jsonString = '{"name": "Coders", "age": 30}';
=======
const jsonString = '{"name": "Rahul", "age": 30}';
>>>>>>> 6c9caef (content Overview Complete)
const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(jsonObject.name); 
console.log(jsonObject.age); 
```

**Output:**
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Coders
=======
Rahul
>>>>>>> 6c9caef (content Overview Complete)
30
