JavaScript Objects
Last Updated : 30 Jul, 2024

In the previous article, we learned about basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) terms and how they apply in JavaScript. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at objects and understand them in more detail.

## Creating Objects

In JavaScript, objects can be created using two different methodologies: **Literal Form** and **Constructed Form**.

### Literal Form
The literal form uses object literals, which are collections of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

```javascript
let obj = {
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2,
    // ...
};
```

### Constructed Form
The constructed way to create an object uses a constructor function or the new keyword. It first makes an empty object, then you add properties to it step by step.

#### Object Constructor Function
In this approach, a function is explicitly created to take required values as parameters and assign them as properties of the object.

```javascript
function Obj(value1, value2) {
    this.key1 = value1;
    this.key2 = value2;
}
```

#### Using `new` Keyword
The `new` keyword is used with a constructor method or a built-in constructor method (such as `Object`, `Date`, `String`, etc.) to create a new instance of an object in memory.

```javascript
let obj = new Object();
obj.key1 = value1;
obj.key2 = value2;
```

### Differences Between Object Literals and Constructed Form
Both ways make the same kind of object. But using object literals is easier because you can add all the key-value pairs at once. The constructed form needs you to add each property one by one.

**Note:** Using the constructed form to create objects is not very common. That’s why most examples will use object literals instead.

## Built-In Objects
JavaScript has some built-in objects that help you create specific types of objects. These built-in functions act like blueprints for making things like dates, numbers, or strings.

- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `Object`
- `Function`
- `Array`
- `Date`
- `RegExp`
- `Error`

### Example: Differentiating Between Objects and Primitives

```javascript
// Create string primitive.
let strPrimitive = "Coding75";
console.log(typeof strPrimitive); // "string"
console.log(strPrimitive instanceof String); // false

// Use the built-in String function as constructor.
let strObject = new String("Coding75");
console.log(typeof strObject); // "object"
console.log(strObject instanceof String); // true

// Inspect the object sub-type
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(strObject)); // [object String]
```

Primitives are immutable values. JavaScript coerces a string primitive into a `String` object when necessary. However, using primitives is preferred due to internal coercion.

## Content of Objects

In JavaScript, objects are made up of key-value pairs. The key is the name of the property, and the value can be a number, text, another object, or even a function.

```javascript
objectName.objectProperty = propertyValue;
```

### Example: Defining Object Properties

```javascript
let myObj = {
    // Integer Property
    int_prop: 5,

    // String Property
    str_prop: "Coding75",

    // Object Property (Date)
    obj_prop: new Date(),

    // Object Property
    inner_obj: {
        int_prop: 6
    },

    // Function Property
    func_prop: function() {
        console.log("Welcome to Coding75!");
    }
};

console.log(myObj.int_prop);
console.log(myObj.str_prop);
console.log(myObj.obj_prop.toLocaleTimeString());
console.log(myObj.inner_obj.int_prop);
myObj.func_prop();
```

### Output
```
5
Coding75
5:47:55 PM
6
Welcome to Coding75!
```

Functions associated with objects are called **methods**. Unlike standalone functions, methods reference the object using the `this` keyword.

## Defining Global Variables in Objects
A function can be explicitly defined and then assigned to an object property, making it a method.

```javascript
// Define Function Explicitly
function toGreet() {
    console.log("Hello There!");
}

let myObj = {
    // Assign function to property
    greet: toGreet,

    // Define function directly
    byWhom: function() {
<<<<<<< HEAD
        console.log(" - Coding75.com");
=======
        console.log(" - Coding75.org");
>>>>>>> 6c9caef (content Overview Complete)
    }
};

myObj.greet();
myObj.byWhom();
```

### Output
```
Hello There!
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - Coding75.com
=======
 - Coding75.org
>>>>>>> 6c9caef (content Overview Complete)
```

## Important Points

- `Date` values can only be created using their constructed object form.
- Objects, arrays, functions, and regular expressions (`RegExp`) are all objects, regardless of their creation method.
- The constructed form provides more customization but is generally not necessary.

This concludes our discussion on JavaScript objects. Next, we will explore more advanced object-related topics.
