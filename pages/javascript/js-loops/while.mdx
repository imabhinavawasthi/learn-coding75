# JavaScript While Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. In JavaScript, this loop evaluates the condition before each iteration and continues running as long as the condition remains true.

Hereâ€™s an example that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```javascript
let count = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Syntax
```javascript
while (condition) {
    // Code block to be executed
}
```

## Using While Loop to Traverse an Array

```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
let i = 0;
while (i < arr.length) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
  i++;
}
```

**Output:**
```
10
20
30
40
```

## Do-While Loop
A do-while loop in JavaScript is like a while loop, but it always runs the code at least once, even if the condition is false initially. It then continues looping as long as the condition remains true.

### Syntax
```javascript
do {
    // Code block to be executed 
} while (condition);
```

### Example: Counting from 1 to 5

```javascript
let count = 1;
do {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
} while (count <= 5);
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Comparison Between While and Do-While Loop
| While Loop | Do-While Loop |
|------------|--------------|
| It is an **entry condition** looping structure. | It is an **exit condition** looping structure. |
| The number of iterations depends on the condition mentioned in the `while` block. | Irrespective of the condition mentioned in the `do-while` block, there will be a minimum of 1 iteration. |
| The block control condition is available at the **starting point** of the loop. | The block control condition is available at the **endpoint** of the loop. |
