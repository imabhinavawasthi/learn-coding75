## JavaScript For Loop

JavaScript `for` loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

```javascript
// for loop begins when x=2
// and runs till x <= 4
for (let x = 2; x <= 4; x++) {
    console.log("Value of x:" + x);
}
```

### Output
```
Value of x:2
Value of x:3
Value of x:4
```

### For loop to print table of a number
```javascript
let x = 5;
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(x * i); 
}
```

### Output
```
5
10
15
20
25
30
35
40
45
50
```

### For loop to print elements of an array
```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]); 
}
```

### Output
```
10
20
30
40
```

## Syntax of For Loop in JavaScript
A `for` loop in JavaScript repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It includes initialization, condition checking, and iteration steps, making it efficient for controlled, repetitive tasks.

### Syntax:
```javascript
for (statement 1 ; statement 2 ; statement 3){
    // code here...
}
```
- **Statement 1**: Initialization of the counter (executed once before the loop starts).
- **Statement 2**: Condition check before each iteration.
- **Statement 3**: Increment or decrement of the counter (executed after each loop iteration).

## Statement 1: Initializing Counter Variable

Statement 1 initializes the counter variable. This variable tracks the number of iterations. It can be initialized inside or outside the loop.

```javascript
let x = 2;

for (; x <= 4; x++) {
    console.log("Value of x:" + x);
}
```

### Output
```
Value of x:2
Value of x:3
Value of x:4
```

## Statement 2: Testing Condition

This statement checks the condition before each iteration. If true, the loop executes; otherwise, it stops. If omitted, the loop runs indefinitely unless manually stopped.

```javascript
let x = 2;
for (; ; x++) {
    console.log("Value of x:" + x);
    break;
}
```

### Output
```
Value of x:2
```

## Statement 3: Updating Counter Variable

This statement updates the counter variable. It is optional and can be placed inside the loop body instead.

```javascript
const subjects = ["Maths", "Science", "Polity", "History"];
let i = 0;
let len = subjects.length;
let gfg = "";
for (; i < len;) {
    gfg += subjects[i];
    // Counter can be incremented inside the loop
    i++;
}
console.log(gfg);
```

### Output
```
MathsSciencePolityHistory
```

## More Loops in JavaScript
JavaScript offers different types of loops:

| Loop          | Description |
|--------------|------------|
| `for` loop   | Repeats a block of code a specific number of times. |
| `while` loop | Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. |
| `do-while` loop | Executes a block of code at least once, then repeats while the condition is true. |
| `for…of` loop | Iterates over the values of iterable objects (arrays, strings, etc.). |
| `for…in` loop | Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object. |
