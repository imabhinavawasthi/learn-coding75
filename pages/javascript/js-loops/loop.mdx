# JavaScript Loops

Loops in JavaScript are used to reduce repetitive tasks by repeatedly executing a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. This makes code more concise and efficient.

Suppose we want to print ‘Hello World’ five times. Instead of manually writing the print statement repeatedly, we can use a loop to automate the task and execute it based on the given condition.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
```

Let’s now discuss the different types of loops available in JavaScript.

## 1. JavaScript for Loop
The `for` loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. It contains initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line.

### Syntax
```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    console.log("Count:", i);
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
```

### How it works:
- Initializes the counter variable (`let i = 1`).
- Tests the condition (`i <= 3`); runs while true.
- Executes the loop body and increments the counter (`i++`).

## 2. JavaScript while Loop
The `while` loop executes as long as the condition is true. It can be thought of as a repeating `if` statement.

### Syntax
```javascript
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
    console.log("Number:", i);
    i++;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 0
Number: 1
Number: 2
```

### How it works:
- Initializes the variable (`let i = 0`).
- Runs the loop body while the condition (`i < 3`) is true.
- Increments the counter after each iteration (`i++`).

## 3. JavaScript do-while Loop
The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop except it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

### Syntax
```javascript
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log("Iteration:", i);
    i++;
} while (i < 3);
```

**Output:**
```
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
```

### How it works:
- Executes the code block first.
- Checks the condition (`i < 3`) after each iteration.

## 4. JavaScript for-in Loop
The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It only iterates over keys of an object that have their enumerable property set to `true`.

### Syntax
```javascript
for (let key in object) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

```javascript
const obj = { name: "Ashish", age: 25 };
for (let key in obj) {
    console.log(key, ":", obj[key]);
}
```

**Output:**
```
name : Ashish
age : 25
```

### How it works:
- Iterates over the keys of the object.
- Accesses both keys and values.

## 5. JavaScript for-of Loop
The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, or sets. It directly iterates the value and has a more concise syntax than the `for` loop.

### Syntax
```javascript
for (let value of iterable) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

```javascript
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let val of a) {
    console.log(val);
}
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Choosing the Right Loop
- **Use `for` loop** when the number of iterations is known.
- **Use `while` loop** when the condition depends on dynamic factors.
- **Use `do-while` loop** to ensure the block executes at least once.
- **Use `for...in` loop** to iterate over object properties.
- **Use `for...of` loop** for iterating through iterable objects.
