# JavaScript While Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. In JavaScript, this loop evaluates the condition before each iteration and continues running as long as the condition remains true.

Here’s an example that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```javascript
let count = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Syntax
```javascript
while (condition) {
    // Code block to be executed
}
```

## Using While Loop to Traverse an Array

```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
let i = 0;
while (i < arr.length) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
  i++;
}
```

**Output:**
```
10
20
30
40
```

## Do-While Loop
A `do-while` loop is another type of loop in JavaScript that is similar to the `while` loop, but with one key difference: the `do-while` loop guarantees that the block of code inside the loop will be executed at least once, regardless of whether the condition is initially true or false.

### Syntax
```javascript
do {
    // Code block to be executed 
} while (condition);
```

### Example: Counting from 1 to 5

```javascript
let count = 1;
do {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
} while (count <= 5);
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Comparison Between While and Do-While Loop
| While Loop | Do-While Loop |
|------------|--------------|
| It is an **entry condition** looping structure. | It is an **exit condition** looping structure. |
| The number of iterations depends on the condition mentioned in the `while` block. | Irrespective of the condition mentioned in the `do-while` block, there will be a minimum of 1 iteration. |
| The block control condition is available at the **starting point** of the loop. | The block control condition is available at the **endpoint** of the loop. |

# JavaScript for...of Loop

The JavaScript `for...of` loop is a modern iteration statement introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).

- Works for iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more.
- It is a better choice for traversing items of iterables compared to traditional `for` and `for...in` loops, especially when we have `break` or `continue` statements. If we just want to perform an operation on all items, we prefer `forEach()`.

## 1. Iterating Over an Array using `for...of`

```javascript
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (const item of a) {
    console.log(item);
}
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Preferred Loops for Iterables
- Use `for...of` if we need to use `continue` or `break` in the loop.
- Use `forEach()` if we need to execute something for all elements without any condition.
- Use `for...in` for iterating over object properties.

## 2. Iterating Over a String using `for...of`

```javascript
const str = "Hello";

for (const char of str) {
    console.log(char);
}
```

**Output:**
```
H
e
l
l
o
```

## 3. Iterating Over a Map using `for...of`

```javascript
const m = new Map([
    ["name", "Akash"],
    ["age", 25],
    ["city", "Noida"]
]);

for (let [key, value] of m) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
```

**Output:**
```
name: Akash
age: 25
city: Noida
```

## 4. Iterating Over a Set using `for...of`

```javascript
let s = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

for (let val of s) {
    console.log(val);
}
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## 5. Iterating Over an Object’s Properties using `for...of`
While the `for...of` loop is not directly used to iterate over object properties, you can use it in combination with `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, or `Object.entries()` to achieve this.

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Akash",
    age: 25,
    city: "Noida"
};

for (let key of Object.keys(person)) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}
```

**Output:**
```
name: Akash
age: 25
city: Noida
```
