## JavaScript do…while Loop

A do…while loop in JavaScript runs a block of code at least once, even if the condition is false initially. It keeps executing the code as long as the condition remains true.

### Types of Loops
- **Entry Controlled Loops**: The condition is tested before entering the loop body (e.g., `for` and `while` loops).
- **Exit Controlled Loops**: The condition is tested after executing the loop body, ensuring at least one execution (e.g., `do…while` loop).

### Syntax
```javascript
do {
    // Statements
} while (condition);
```

### Example 1: Using `do…while` Loop
```javascript
let test = 1;
do {
    console.log(test);
    test++;
} while (test <= 5);
```

### Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Difference Between `do…while` and `while` Loop
Unlike the `while` loop, a `do…while` loop **always runs at least once**, even if the condition is false.

### Example 2: Difference Between `do…while` and `while`
```javascript
let test = 1;
do {
    console.log(test);
} while (test < 1);

while (test < 1) {
    console.log(test);
}
```

### Output
```
1
```

#### Explanation
- The `do…while` loop executes **once**, even though the condition is false.
- The `while` loop checks the condition first and **does not execute** if the condition is false.

### Comparison Table
| `do…while` | `while` |
|------------|--------|
| Exit-controlled loop | Entry-controlled loop |
| Executes at least once | May not execute at all |
| Condition is checked at the end | Condition is checked at the beginning |

### Important Note
When writing loop conditions, always ensure there is a termination condition; otherwise, the loop may run infinitely and crash the browser.
