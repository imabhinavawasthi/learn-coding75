## JavaScript For In Loop

The JavaScript `for…in` loop iterates over the properties of an object. It allows you to access each key or property name of an object.

```javascript
const car = {
    make: "Toyota",
    model: "Corolla",
    year: 2020
};

for (let key in car) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${car[key]}`);
}
```

### Output
```
make: Toyota
model: Corolla
year: 2020
```

## Syntax
```javascript
for (key in object) {
    // Code
}
```

The `for…in` loop can also iterate over the properties of an array, but it is **not recommended**. `for..in` is mainly suitable for objects.

For arrays, we should use the following loops:

- **`for…of` Loop**: If we need to use `continue` or `break` inside the loop.
- **`forEach()` Method**: If we need to execute something for all elements without any condition.

### Example: Using `for…in` for Arrays (Not Recommended)
```javascript
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (const i in a) {
    console.log(a[i]);
}
```

### Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Important Facts About `for…in` Loop
- The `for…in` loop is **not recommended** for arrays if maintaining index order is important.
- The order of iteration in a `for…in` loop is **implementation-dependent**, meaning the array elements may not be accessed in the expected sequence.
- The order in which object properties are iterated may not match the order in which they were defined in the object.

## JavaScript do…while Loop

A `do…while` loop in JavaScript is a control structure where the code executes repeatedly based on a given boolean condition. One key difference is that a `do…while` loop guarantees that the code block will execute **at least once**, regardless of whether the condition is met initially.

### Types of Loops
- **Entry Controlled Loops**: The condition is tested before entering the loop body (e.g., `for` and `while` loops).
- **Exit Controlled Loops**: The condition is tested after executing the loop body, ensuring at least one execution (e.g., `do…while` loop).

### Syntax
```javascript
do {
    // Statements
} while (condition);
```

### Example 1: Using `do…while` Loop
```javascript
let test = 1;
do {
    console.log(test);
    test++;
} while (test <= 5);
```

### Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Difference Between `do…while` and `while` Loop
Unlike the `while` loop, a `do…while` loop **always runs at least once**, even if the condition is false.

### Example 2: Difference Between `do…while` and `while`
```javascript
let test = 1;
do {
    console.log(test);
} while (test < 1);

while (test < 1) {
    console.log(test);
}
```

### Output
```
1
```

#### Explanation
- The `do…while` loop executes **once**, even though the condition is false.
- The `while` loop checks the condition first and **does not execute** if the condition is false.

### Comparison Table
| `do…while` | `while` |
|------------|--------|
| Exit-controlled loop | Entry-controlled loop |
| Executes at least once | May not execute at all |
| Condition is checked at the end | Condition is checked at the beginning |

### Important Note
When writing loop conditions, always ensure there is a termination condition; otherwise, the loop may run infinitely and crash the browser.
