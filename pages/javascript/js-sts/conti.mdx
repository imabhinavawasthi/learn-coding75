# Continue Statement

The `continue` statement in JavaScript is used to break the iteration of the loop and follow with the next iteration.

## Example of continue to print only odd Numbers smaller than 10

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) continue;
    console.log(i);
}
```

**Output:**
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

## How Does Continue Work?
If `continue` is used in a `for` loop, the control flow jumps to the test expression after skipping the current iteration.

### Continue vs Break
The major difference between the `continue` and `break` statement is that the `break` statement breaks out of the loop completely while `continue` is used to break one iteration and move to the next.

## How does the continue statement work for while loop? 
With `continue`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and control flow resumes in the next iteration of the `while` loop.

### Using Continue in While Loop
In the example below, the condition is checked, and if `continue` is encountered, the next iteration of the loop starts.

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 11) {
    i++;
    if (i % 2 == 0) continue;
    console.log(i);
}
```

**Output:**
```
