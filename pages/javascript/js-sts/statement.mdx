JavaScript statements are programming instructions that a computer executes. A computer program is essentially a list of these “instructions” designed to perform tasks. In a programming language, such instructions are called statements.

## Types of Statements

### 1. Variable Declarations (`var`, `let`, `const`)
In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`. `let` and `const` are used in modern JavaScript for block-scoped variables, while `var` is function-scoped and generally considered outdated.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{`
let name = "Mohan";   // Declaration with 'let'
const age = 25;      // Declaration with 'const' (constant value)
var isActive = true; // Declaration with 'var' (older version)
`}</CodeBlock>

### 2. Assignment Statement
An assignment statement is used to assign a value to a variable. You can assign any type of value, including strings, numbers, and objects, using the assignment operator `=`.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{`
let number = 10; // Assigning a number
let message = "Hello, World!"; // Assigning a string
`}</CodeBlock>

### 3. Expression Statements
An expression in JavaScript is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value. When an expression is executed, it can perform an action (e.g., calculation, function call) and return a result. An expression can also be used as a statement.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{`
x = y + 10;  // Expression statement
console.log(x); // Expression statement using a function call
`}</CodeBlock>

### 4. Control Flow Statements
Control flow statements are used to control the order in which statements are executed in a program. Examples include `if`, `else`, `switch`, `while`, and `for` loops.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{`
let number = 10;
if (number > 5) {
    console.log("Number is greater than 5");
}
`}</CodeBlock>

### 5. Function Declarations
A function declaration is a statement that defines a function in JavaScript. Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{`
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
}

console.log(greet("Alisha"));
`}</CodeBlock>

### 6. Return Statement
The `return` statement is used to exit a function and optionally pass a value back to the calling code.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{`
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}
let result = add(5, 3); // result will be 8
`}</CodeBlock>

### 7. Throw Statement
The `throw` statement is used to create custom errors in JavaScript. It is often used in conjunction with `try…catch` to handle errors.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{`
function checkAge(age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new Error("Age must be 18 or older");
    }
}
`}</CodeBlock>

### 8. Try…Catch Statement
The `try…catch` statement is used to handle exceptions in JavaScript. The code inside the `try` block is executed, and if an error occurs, the code inside the `catch` block will handle the error.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{`
try {
    let result = someUndefinedFunction(); // This will throw an error
    console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
}
`}</CodeBlock>

### 9. Break and Continue Statements
The `break` and `continue` statements are used within loops. `break` exits the loop, while `continue` skips to the next iteration.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{`
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break;  // Exits the loop when i equals 5
    }
    console.log(i);
}
`}</CodeBlock>

| `if`      | Used to decide if a certain block will get executed or not |
| `switch`  | Executes a block of code depending on different cases |
| `for`     | Executes a block of statements till the condition is true |
| `function`| Used to declare a function |
| `return`  | Used to exit a function |
| `try`     | Used to handle errors in a block of statements |
