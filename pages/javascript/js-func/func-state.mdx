A JavaScript function is a block of code that runs only when called (invoked). It performs a specific task and helps make code reusable. JavaScript offers multiple ways to define functions, each with its own syntax and purpose.

Below are the ways of writing functions in JavaScript:

## 1. Function Declaration
A Function Declaration is a standard way to define a function using the function keyword, followed by a name and optional parameters. It can be called before its definition due to hoisting.

Example: Below is an example that illustrates the use of Function Declaration.

```javascript
// Function declaration 
function add(a, b) {         
    console.log(a + b);
}

// Calling a function
add(2, 3);
```

### Output:
```
5
```
After defining a function, we call it whenever the function is required.

## 2. Function Expression
Function Expression is another way to define a function. Here, the function is defined inside a variable, and the function’s value (its returned value) is stored in that variable.

Example: Below is an example that illustrates the use of Function Expression.

```javascript
// Function Expression
const add = function (a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

// Calling function
add(2, 3);
```

### Output:
```
5
```
Here, the whole function is an expression, and the returned value is stored in the variable. We use the variable name to call the function.

## 3. Arrow Functions
Arrow Functions were introduced in ES6 (a newer version of JavaScript). They provide a shorter syntax for writing functions. Instead of using the `function` keyword, you use an arrow (`=>`).

Example: Below is an example that illustrates the use of the Arrow Function.

```javascript
// Single line of code
let add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(3, 2));
```

### Output:
```
5
```
This shortens the code to a single line compared to other approaches. In a single line of code, the function returns implicitly.

**Note:** When there is a need to include multiple lines of code, we use brackets. Also, when there are multiple lines of code in the bracket, we should write `return` explicitly to return the value from the function.

Example: This is an example with multiple lines of code in an arrow function.

```javascript
// Multiple lines of code
const great = (a, b) => {
    if (a > b)
        return "a is greater";
    else
        return "b is greater";
};
console.log(great(3, 5));
```

### Output:
```
b is greater
```

## Key Differences: Function Declaration vs. Function Expression
- **Function Declaration:** The function is defined and can be called anywhere in the code (even before it’s defined, due to something called “hoisting”).
- **Function Expression:** The function is defined as part of an expression (usually assigned to a variable), and it can only be called after the line where it’s defined.

## 4. Function States in JavaScript
### Function Declaration
```javascript
function Person() {
    name = "Vikash";
    age = "22";
}
```

### Function Expression
```javascript
// Function declaration
function person() { }
let person = person();
 
console.log(person);
 
function person1(name) {
    return name;
}
 
let person1 = person1("Aayush");
console.log(person1);
```

### Output:
```
undefined
Aayush
```

An `undefined` will print because the function doesn’t return any value, whereas the second function returns the name value, which is why the name is printed in the second line.

### Function Constructor
```javascript
// Creating the function
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}
 
// Calling the function 
let person = new Person("Vikash", 22);
 
console.log(person.name);
console.log(person.age);
```

### Output:
```
Vikash
22
```
