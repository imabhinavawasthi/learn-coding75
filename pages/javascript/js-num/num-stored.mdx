In this article, we will try to understand how numbers are stored in JavaScript. Like any other programming language, all the data is stored inside the computer in the form of binary numbers 0 and 1. Since computers can only understand and process data in the form of 0’s and 1’s.

## Number Storage in JavaScript

In JavaScript, there is generally only a `Number` as a primitive data type, but numbers exist in the form of **integers** and **floats**. These types come under the `Number` data type and are internally stored in different formats depending on the type of operation being performed on them.

### Storing of Integer Numbers

Integer numbers are further divided into:

- **Signed Integers**
- **Unsigned Integers**

Unsigned integers use a simple binary format.

```js
let a = 4;
let b = 78;
console.log(a.toString(2)); // "100"
console.log(b.toString(2)); // "1001110"
```

### Signed Magnitude Representation

To store signed numbers, the leftmost bit is used as a sign bit: `0` for positive and `1` for negative numbers.

```js
let a = 6;  // 000110
let b = -6; // 100110 (Signed Magnitude Representation)
```

### One’s Complement Representation

One’s complement toggles all bits (0s to 1s and vice versa).

```js
let num = 24; // 011000 (Binary Representation)
let onesComplement = ~num; // 100111 (One's Complement)
console.log(onesComplement);
```

### Two’s Complement Representation

Two’s complement is obtained by adding `1` to the one’s complement.

```js
let num = 24; // 011000 (Binary Representation)
let twosComplement = ~num + 1; // 101000 (Two’s Complement)
console.log(twosComplement);
```

### Storing Floating Point Numbers

Floating point numbers are stored in three parts:

- **Sign Bit**: Indicates positive (`0`) or negative (`1`).
- **Exponent**: Difference between the real binary number and its normalized form.
- **Mantissa**: Fraction part of the floating-point number’s normalized form.

#### Single vs Double Precision

| Type   | Sign Bit | Exponent | Mantissa |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Single | 1 bit   | 8 bits    | 23 bits   |
| Double | 1 bit   | 11 bits   | 52 bits   |

#### Example: Scientific Notation Representation

```js
// Binary Representation of 101.101 in Scientific Notation
// Normalized form: 1.01101 * 2^2
let signBit = 0;
let exponent = 2;
let mantissa = "01101";
console.log({ signBit, exponent, mantissa });
```

### Problems with Floating Point Numbers in JavaScript

Floating point numbers may not always give accurate results.

```js
let x = 0.1;
let y = 0.2;
console.log(x + y); // Output: 0.30000000000000004
```

#### Associativity Issue in Floating Point Numbers

```js
let x = 0.1;
let y = 0.2;
let z = 0.3;
console.log((x + y) + z); // 0.6000000000000001
console.log(x + (y + z)); // 0.6
```

### Conclusion

- **Unsigned Integers** are stored in simple binary format.
- **Signed Integers** use **Two’s Complement** representation.
- **Floating-Point Numbers** follow **IEEE 754 (Single or Double Precision)**.
- **Floating-Point Arithmetic** can cause rounding issues due to binary limitations.

Understanding these concepts helps in writing efficient and accurate numerical computations in JavaScript.
