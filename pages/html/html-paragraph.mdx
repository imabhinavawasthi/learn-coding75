# HTML Paragraphs

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

## HTML Paragraphs

The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

### Example

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph
contains         a lot of spaces
in the source         code,
but the        browser
ignores it.
</p>

## HTML Horizontal Rules

The `<hr>` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

## HTML Line Breaks

The HTML `<br>` element defines a line break.

Use `<br>` if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

### Example

```html
<p>This is<br>a line break.</p>
```
