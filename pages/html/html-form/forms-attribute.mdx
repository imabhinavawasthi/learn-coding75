# HTML Form Attributes

This chapter describes the different attributes for the HTML `<form>` element.

## The Action Attribute

The `action` attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called `"action_page.php"`. This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:

### Example
On submit, send form data to `"action_page.php"`:

```html
<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

## The Target Attribute

The `target` attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.

The `target` attribute can have one of the following values:

| Value       | Description                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `_blank`    | The response is displayed in a new window or tab      |
| `_self`     | The response is displayed in the current window       |
| `_parent`   | The response is displayed in the parent frame         |
| `_top`      | The response is displayed in the full body of window  |
| `framename` | The response is displayed in a named iframe           |


## The Method Attribute

The `method` attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with `method="get"`) or as an HTTP POST transaction (with `method="post"`).

The default HTTP method when submitting form data is **GET**.

### Example

This example uses the **GET** method when submitting the form data:

```html
<form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
