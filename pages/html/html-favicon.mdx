## HTML Favicon

A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.

### How To Add a Favicon in HTML

You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites like [favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc).

>  **Tip:** A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.

A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab, like this:

### Example of Favicon

To add a favicon to your website, either:

- Save your favicon image to the **root directory** of your webserver,  
**OR**
- Create a folder in the root directory called `images`, and save your favicon image in this folder.

A common name for a favicon image is `favicon.ico`.

Next, add a `<link>` element to your `index.html` file, **after** the `<title>` element, like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page Title</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
