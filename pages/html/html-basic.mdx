## HTML Documents

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

- The HTML document begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`.
- The **visible part** of the document is between `<body>` and `</body>`.

### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
  <p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

## The `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration

- The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines the **document type**
- It helps browsers **display web pages correctly**
- It must appear **only once** at the **top of the page**
- It is **not case sensitive**
