# SQL Subquery

A **Subquery** is a query within another SQL query and is embedded within the `WHERE` clause.

## Important Rules

- A subquery can be placed in a number of SQL clauses like the `WHERE`, `FROM`, and `HAVING` clauses.
- You can use a subquery with `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` statements along with operators like `=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, etc.
- A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is known as the **main query**, and the inner query is known as a **subquery**.
- Subqueries are on the right side of the comparison operator.
- A subquery is always enclosed in **parentheses**.
- In the subquery, the `ORDER BY` command cannot be used. However, the `GROUP BY` command can be used to perform the same function as `ORDER BY`.

# Subqueries with the INSERT Statement

A **SQL subquery** can also be used with the `INSERT` statement. In this case, data returned from the subquery is used to insert into another table.

- In the subquery, the selected data can be modified using any of the character or date functions.

## Syntax

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE value_operator;

# Subqueries with the UPDATE Statement

A **SQL subquery** can be used in conjunction with the `UPDATE` statement. When a subquery is used with the `UPDATE` statement, either a single or multiple columns in a table can be updated.

## Syntax

```sql
UPDATE table
SET column_name = new_value
WHERE value_operator (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

# Subqueries with the DELETE Statement

A **SQL subquery** can be used in conjunction with the `DELETE` statement, just like with other SQL statements.

## Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE value_operator (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
