# Views in SQL

- **Views** in SQL are considered as **virtual tables**.
- A view also contains **rows and columns**, but unlike tables, it does not store data physically.
- To create a view, we can select fields from **one or more tables** present in the database.
- A view can either display **specific rows** based on a certain condition or show **all the rows** of a table.

## Creating a View

A view can be created using the `CREATE VIEW` statement. Views can be created from a **single table** or **multiple tables**.

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

# Creating a View from Multiple Tables

A view from multiple tables can be created by simply including multiple tables in the `SELECT` statement.

In the given example, a view named **MarksView** is created from two tables: `Student_Detail` and `Student_Marks`.

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE VIEW MarksView AS
SELECT Student_Detail.NAME, Student_Detail.ADDRESS, Student_Marks.MARKS
FROM Student_Detail, Student_Marks
WHERE Student_Detail.NAME = Student_Marks.NAME;
