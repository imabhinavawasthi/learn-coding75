# What is SQL?

- **SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language**.
- It is used for storing and managing data in **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**.
- It is a **standard language** for working with relational databases.
- SQL enables users to **create, read, update, and delete** (CRUD) data in relational databases and tables.
- All major RDBMS systems like **MySQL**, **Informix**, **Oracle**, **MS Access**, and **SQL Server** use SQL as their standard database language.
- SQL allows users to **query the database** in various ways using **English-like statements**.

# What are the Rules of SQL?

SQL follows the following rules:

- **Structured Query Language (SQL)** is **not case sensitive**. However, SQL **keywords are generally written in uppercase**.
- SQL **statements are not dependent on text lines**. A single SQL statement can span one or multiple lines.
- Using SQL statements, you can **perform most database actions**, such as creating, updating, deleting, and querying data.
- SQL is **based on tuple relational calculus and relational algebra**.

# What is SQL Process?

- When an **SQL command is executed** in any **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**, the system figures out the **best way to carry out the request**.
- The **SQL engine** determines **how to interpret and execute the task**.
- This process involves several components, including:
  - **Optimization Engine**
  - **Query Engine**
  - **Query Dispatcher**
  - **Classic Query Engine**, etc.
- All **non-SQL queries** are handled by the **Classic Query Engine**, whereas the **SQL Query Engine does not handle logical files**.
