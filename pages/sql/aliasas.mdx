# SQL Aliases

SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

An alias only exists for the duration of that query.

An alias is created with the `AS` keyword.

## Example:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID AS ID
FROM Customers;
```
# SQL Aliases

An alias is a temporary name that you can assign to a table or a column within a query. It is mainly used to make column names or table names more readable, especially when the original names are long, complex, or unclear.

##  Key Points About Aliases:

- **Temporary**: An alias only exists for the duration of the query. It does not modify the actual table or column name in the database.
- **Readability**: Aliases make your SQL queries more readable and easier to understand.
- **Creation**: Aliases are created using the `AS` keyword (optional in some cases).
- **Usage**: Aliases can be applied to both tables and columns.

##  Why Use Aliases?

- To simplify complex table or column names.
- To make the results of queries more understandable.
- To improve the readability of SQL queries, especially when working with multiple tables or joining tables.
