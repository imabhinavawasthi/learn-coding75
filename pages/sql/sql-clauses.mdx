# SQL Clauses

SQL clauses are an essential part of SQL queries and help to filter, sort, and limit the data returned from a database. Some of the most commonly used SQL clauses are:

# WHERE
The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records that meet certain conditions.

### Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

```

# GROUP BY

The **SQL `GROUP BY`** statement is used to arrange identical data into groups.

- The `GROUP BY` statement is used with the **SQL `SELECT`** statement.
- The `GROUP BY` statement follows the `WHERE` clause in a `SELECT` statement and precedes the `ORDER BY` clause.
- The `GROUP BY` statement is often used with aggregation functions (like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.).

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...
ORDER BY column_name;
```
# HAVING

- The **HAVING** clause is used to specify a search condition for a group or an aggregate.
- **HAVING** is used in a `GROUP BY` clause. If you are not using `GROUP BY` clause, then you can use the **HAVING** function like a `WHERE` clause.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column1, column2;

```

# ORDER BY

- The **ORDER BY** clause sorts the result-set in ascending or descending order.
- It sorts the records in ascending order by default. The `DESC` keyword is used to sort the records in descending order.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column1, column2 ... ASC | DESC;
