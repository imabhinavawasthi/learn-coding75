# SQL Operators

SQL operators are used to perform operations on data in SQL statements. These are mainly categorized into:

- **Arithmetic Operators**
- **Comparison Operators**
- **Logical Operators**

## SQL Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `+`      | Adds values of both operands. |
| `-`      | Subtracts the right-hand operand from the left-hand operand. |
| `*`      | Multiplies values of both operands. |
| `/`      | Divides the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand. |
| `%`      | Returns the remainder of the division between two operands. |

## SQL Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `=`      | Checks if the values of two operands are equal. |
| `!=`     | Checks if the values of two operands are not equal. |
| `<>`     | Same as `!=`, checks for inequality. |
| `>`      | Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand. |
| `<`      | Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand. |
| `>=`     | Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. |
| `<=`     | Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. |
| `!>`     | Checks if the left operand is **not greater** than the right operand. |
| `!<`     | Checks if the left operand is **not less** than the right operand. |

## SQL Logical Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AND`    | Returns true if **both** conditions are true. |
| `OR`     | Returns true if **any one** condition is true. |
| `NOT`    | Reverses the result of the condition (i.e., true becomes false, and vice versa). |
