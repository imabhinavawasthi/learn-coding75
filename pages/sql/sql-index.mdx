# SQL Index

- **Indexes** are special lookup tables used to retrieve data from the database very quickly.
- An index is used to **speed up** `SELECT` queries and `WHERE` clauses. However, it may **slow down** data input operations like `INSERT` and `UPDATE`.
- Indexes can be created or dropped without affecting the data in the database.
- An index in a database is similar to an **index in the back of a book**â€”it helps you locate information quickly.

## Creating an Index

You can create an index using the `CREATE INDEX` statement.

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);

# Unique Index in SQL

A **Unique Index** ensures that the values in the indexed columns are unique.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
