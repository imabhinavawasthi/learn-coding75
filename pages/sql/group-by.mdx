# SQL GROUP BY Statement

The `GROUP BY` statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

The `GROUP BY` statement is often used with aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

```

# SQL GROUP BY Statement

The `GROUP BY` statement is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. This is often done in conjunction with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, or `MIN()` to perform calculations on each group of data.

##  Key Concepts:

- **Grouping Data**: `GROUP BY` groups rows based on one or more columns.
- **Aggregation**: It is commonly used with aggregate functions to return a summarized result for each group.
- **ORDER BY**: You can also use `ORDER BY` to sort the result-set based on the grouped data.

##  Why Use `GROUP BY`?

To calculate **statistics** or **summaries** for different groups within a dataset, such as the total sales per region or the number of orders per customer.

It helps in **organizing** data and simplifying reports, analysis, and insights.
