# SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint

The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.

- Primary keys must contain **UNIQUE** values.
- Primary keys **cannot contain NULL** values.
- A table can have only **ONE** primary key.
- A primary key can consist of a **single** column or **multiple** columns.

## SQL PRIMARY KEY on CREATE TABLE

The following SQL creates a `PRIMARY KEY` on the `"ID"` column when the `"Persons"` table is created:

**MySQL:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```

## Key Characteristics of a Primary Key:

- **Uniqueness**: Every value in the primary key column(s) must be unique.
- **No NULLs**: A primary key column cannot have `NULL` values.
- **One per table**: Each table can have only **one** primary key.
- **Can be composite**: A primary key can be made up of **one or more columns** (called a composite key).

##  Why Use a Primary Key?

To make sure that each row in a table can be **uniquely and reliably** identified â€” which is critical for **data integrity**, **relationships** (via foreign keys), and **performance**.
