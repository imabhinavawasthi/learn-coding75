# What is SQL Datatype?

- **SQL Datatype** is used to define the **type of values** that a column can contain.
- Every **column** in a database table must have a **name** and an associated **data type**.

## Common SQL Data Types

1. **Binary**  
   Used to store binary data such as images or files.

2. **Numeric**  
   Represents numeric values like integers and floating-point numbers.  
   Examples: `INT`, `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`

3. **Exact Numeric**  
   Used for precise numeric values.  
   Examples: `DECIMAL(p, s)`, `NUMERIC(p, s)`

4. **String**  
   Used to store character data.  
   Examples: `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`

5. **Date/Time**  
   Used to store date and time information.  
   Examples: `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`

   # SQL Commands

- **SQL commands** are instructions used to **communicate with a database**.
- They are used to **perform specific tasks**, such as querying data, managing tables, and controlling access.
- SQL can perform various operations like:
  - Creating tables
  - Adding data to tables
  - Modifying tables
  - Dropping tables
  - Setting user permissions

## Types of SQL Commands

There are **five main types** of SQL commands:

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**  
   - Defines database structure  
   - Examples: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`

2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**  
   - Manages data within tables  
   - Examples: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

3. **DCL (Data Control Language)**  
   - Controls access to data  
   - Examples: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`

4. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**  
   - Manages transactions in the database  
   - Examples: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`

5. **DQL (Data Query Language)**  
   - Retrieves data from the database  
   - Example: `SELECT`

# Data Definition Language (DDL)

- **DDL** is used to **change the structure** of database tables.
- It includes operations like **creating**, **deleting**, and **modifying** tables.
- All DDL commands are **auto-committed**, meaning changes are **permanently saved** in the database once executed.

## Common DDL Commands

- `CREATE`
- `ALTER`
- `DROP`
- `TRUNCATE`

# Data Manipulation Language (DML)

- **DML commands** are used to **modify the database**.
- They are responsible for making **changes to the data** stored in tables.
- **DML commands are not auto-committed**, which means changes are **not saved permanently** until explicitly committed.
- These changes can be **rolled back** if needed.

## Common DML Commands

- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`

# Data Control Language (DCL)

- **DCL commands** are used to **grant or revoke access** and authority to users on the database.

## Common DCL Commands

- `GRANT`
- `REVOKE`

---

# Transaction Control Language (TCL)

- **TCL commands** are used to manage **transactions** in the database.
- These commands are only used with **DML operations** like `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`.
- Since **DDL operations are auto-committed**, TCL commands **cannot be used** with them.

## Common TCL Commands

- `COMMIT`
- `ROLLBACK`
- `SAVEPOINT`

---

# Data Query Language (DQL)

- **DQL** is used to **fetch data** from the database.
- It mainly uses the **`SELECT`** command.

## `SELECT` Command

- Works like the **projection** operation in relational algebra.
- It is used to **select attributes (columns)** based on a **condition** specified in the `WHERE` clause.
