# Implementing a Stack Using a Singly Linked List

A **stack** is a data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle, meaning the last item added is the first one removed. We can implement a stack using a **singly linked list**, which allows the stack to grow and shrink dynamically without worrying about a fixed size.

## How It Works

In a singly linked list, each **node** contains:

- **Data** (the value stored in the node)
- **A pointer to the next node** in the list

The **top** pointer keeps track of the first node in the stack, where push and pop operations happen.

### Why Use a Linked List Instead of an Array?

- **Dynamic Size:** The stack can grow or shrink as needed.
- **No Overflow:** Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size, a linked list stack does not run out of space as long as memory is available.
- **Efficient Memory Usage:** Unlike doubly linked lists, singly linked lists use less memory because they only store one pointer per node.

## Stack Operations

### `push()`: Add an element to the stack

1. Create a new node with the given data.
2. Set the new node's `next` pointer to the current `top` node.
3. Update `top` to the new node.

### `pop()`: Remove the top element

1. Check if the stack is empty.
2. If not, save the current `top` node in a temporary variable.
3. Move `top` to the next node.
4. Free the memory of the removed node.

### `peek()`: Get the top element

1. Check if the stack is empty.
2. If not, return the value of the `top` node.

### `display()`: Show all elements in the stack

1. Start from the `top` node.
2. Traverse the list and print each node's value.

## C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int new_data) {
        data = new_data;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};

class Stack {
    Node* top;
public:
    Stack() { top = nullptr; }
    bool isEmpty() { return top == nullptr; }

    void push(int new_data) {
        Node* new_node = new Node(new_data);
        new_node->next = top;
        top = new_node;
    }

    void pop() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "\nStack Underflow";
            return;
        }
        Node* temp = top;
        top = top->next;
        delete temp;
    }

    int peek() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "\nStack is empty";
            return -1;
        }
        return top->data;
    }
};

int main() {
    Stack st;
    st.push(11);
    st.push(22);
    st.push(33);
    st.push(44);

    cout << "Top element is " << st.peek() << endl;

    cout << "Removing two elements..." << endl;
    st.pop();
    st.pop();

    cout << "Top element is " << st.peek() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```
Top element is 44
Removing two elements...
Top element is 22
```

### Time Complexity

- **push()**: O(1)
- **pop()**: O(1)
- **peek()**: O(1)

### Space Complexity

- **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of elements in the stack.

## Real-World Applications of Stacks

Stacks are used in many applications where **LIFO** order is required:

1. **Function Call Stack**: Stores function calls so the program can return to the previous function after execution.
2. **Undo/Redo Operations**: Tracks changes in text editors and graphic design software.
3. **Browser History**: Stores visited web pages, allowing users to navigate backward.
4. **Expression Evaluation**: Used in compilers for arithmetic and logical expression evaluation.
5. **Recursion Call Stack**: Helps manage function calls in recursive algorithms.
