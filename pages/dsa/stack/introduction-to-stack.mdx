# **Understanding Stack in Data Structures**

A **stack** is a way of organizing data where the last item added is the first one removed. This is called the **LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle**.

## Real-Life Examples of Stack

To understand this better, think of:

- **A stack of plates** – You add new plates on top and remove them from the top.
- **A shuttlecock box** – The first shuttlecock you put in is at the bottom, and the last one added is the first to come out.

## How Stack Works

Since a stack follows the LIFO rule, all actions (adding and removing elements) happen from the **same end**.

## Types of Stack

#### 1. Fixed Size Stack

- Has a set size and cannot grow or shrink.
- If it’s full, adding more elements causes an **overflow error**.
- If it’s empty, trying to remove an element causes an **underflow error**.

#### 2. Dynamic Size Stack

- Can **grow** and **shrink** automatically.
- Uses a **linked list** to allow resizing as needed.

## Basic Operations on a Stack

To work with a stack, we use these operations:

- **push()** – Adds an element to the stack.
- **pop()** – Removes the top element.
- **top()** – Gets the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty()** – Checks if the stack is empty.
- **isFull()** – Checks if the stack is full.

## How Stack Operations Work

### Push (Adding an Element)

```javascript
function push(stack, element, capacity) {
  if (stack.length === capacity) {
    console.log("Stack Overflow");
    return;
  }
  stack.push(element);
}
```

### Pop (Removing an Element)

```javascript
function pop(stack) {
  if (stack.length === 0) {
    console.log("Stack Underflow");
    return;
  }
  return stack.pop();
}
```

### Top (Viewing the Top Element)

```javascript
function top(stack) {
  if (stack.length === 0) {
    console.log("Stack is empty");
    return;
  }
  return stack[stack.length - 1];
}
```

### isEmpty (Checking if Stack is Empty)

```javascript
function isEmpty(stack) {
  return stack.length === 0;
}
```

### isFull (Checking if Stack is Full)

```javascript
function isFull(stack, capacity) {
  return stack.length === capacity;
}
```
