# Introduction to Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that store multiple elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. They offer an efficient way to manage collections of data.

## Key Terminologies

- **Array Index**: Each element in an array is identified by an index, starting from 0.
- **Array Element**: Individual items stored in an array, accessed using their respective index.
- **Array Length**: The total number of elements an array can hold.

## Memory Representation

Arrays store elements sequentially in memory, which allows for quick access and efficient manipulation.

## Declaring an Array

Array declarations vary across programming languages. Below are some C++ examples:

```cpp
// Integer array
int arr[5];

// Character array
char arr[10];

// Floating-point array
float arr[20];
```

## Initializing an Array

An array can be initialized at the time of declaration:

```cpp
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
char arr[5] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
float arr[10] = {1.4, 2.0, 24, 5.0, 0.0};
```

## Why Use Arrays?

Managing multiple variables individually can be inefficient. Arrays provide a structured way to store and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently.

## Types of Arrays

### Based on Size

#### 1. Fixed-Size Arrays

Fixed-size arrays have a predefined length that cannot be modified after allocation.

```cpp
// Compile-time fixed-size array
int arr[5];

// Initialized fixed-size array
int arr2[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Dynamically allocated array
int *arr = new int[5];
```

#### 2. Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays can grow or shrink during runtime, offering flexibility.

```cpp
#include <vector>
vector<int> v; // Dynamic integer array
```

### Based on Dimensions

#### 1. One-Dimensional Arrays (1D)

A 1D array stores elements in a linear sequence.

#### 2. Multi-Dimensional Arrays

Multi-dimensional arrays can represent complex structures like tables.

**Two-Dimensional Array (2D Matrix)**

```cpp
int matrix[3][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
```

**Three-Dimensional Array (3D)**

```cpp
int array3D[2][2][2] = {{{1,2}, {3,4}}, {{5,6}, {7,8}}};
```

## Array Operations

### 1. Traversal

Iterating through an array to access its elements.

```cpp
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << arr[i] << " ";
}
```

### 2. Insertion

Adding an element at a specific position requires shifting elements.

```cpp
int arr[6] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int pos = 2, value = 25;

// Shift elements
for (int i = 5; i > pos; i--) {
    arr[i] = arr[i - 1];
}
arr[pos] = value;
```

### 3. Deletion

Removing an element requires shifting remaining elements.

```cpp
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int pos = 2;

// Shift elements
for (int i = pos; i < 4; i++) {
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
}
```
