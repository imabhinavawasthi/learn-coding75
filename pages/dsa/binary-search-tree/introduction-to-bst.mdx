# Introduction to Binary Search Tree (BST)

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a special type of binary tree that maintains a specific order among its nodes, which allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Properties of a BST

A BST follows these properties:

- The **left subtree** of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node’s key.
- The **right subtree** of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node’s key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be **binary search trees**.

## Advantages of BST

- **Efficient Searching**: Search operations take O(log n) time in a balanced BST.
- **Ordered Structure**: BST maintains elements in a sorted order, which is useful for in-order traversal.
- **Flexible Insertion & Deletion**: Nodes can be inserted or deleted while maintaining order.

## Operations in a BST

### 1. Search Operation
To find a value in a BST:
- Start from the root.
- If the value is **less than** the root, search in the **left subtree**.
- If the value is **greater than** the root, search in the **right subtree**.
- Repeat until the value is found or the subtree becomes null.

### 2. Insertion Operation
- Start from the root.
- Find the appropriate position based on BST rules.
- Insert the new node while maintaining BST properties.

### 3. Deletion Operation
Deletion in a BST has three cases:
1. **Node with no children**: Simply remove the node.
2. **Node with one child**: Replace the node with its child.
3. **Node with two children**: Replace the node with its **inorder successor** or **predecessor**.

## Applications of BST
- **Database Indexing**: BSTs are used for indexing large datasets.
- **Auto-Suggestions**: BSTs help in predictive text algorithms.
- **Symbol Tables**: Used in compilers and interpreters.
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**: Many efficient algorithms rely on BST structure.
