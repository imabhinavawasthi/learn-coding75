# Types of Binary Trees

## Types Based on the Number of Children

### Full Binary Tree

A **Full Binary Tree** is a binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. In other words, all non-leaf nodes must have exactly two children.

A full binary tree is also referred to as a **proper binary tree**.

### Degenerate (Pathological) Tree

A **Degenerate Tree** is a binary tree where each internal node has only one child. Such trees perform similarly to a linked list in terms of efficiency.

### Skewed Binary Tree

A **Skewed Binary Tree** is a special case of a degenerate tree where all nodes are skewed either to the left or right, resulting in:

- **Left-Skewed Binary Tree**
- **Right-Skewed Binary Tree**

## Types Based on Level Completion

### Complete Binary Tree

A **Complete Binary Tree** is a binary tree where:

- Every level is fully filled except possibly the last level.
- The last level has nodes as left as possible.

### Perfect Binary Tree

A **Perfect Binary Tree** is a binary tree where:

- All internal nodes have exactly two children.
- All leaf nodes are at the same level.

A perfect binary tree of height `h` contains `2^(h+1) - 1` nodes.

### Balanced Binary Tree

A **Balanced Binary Tree** is a binary tree where the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most **1**.

Examples:

- **AVL Tree** ensures balance by maintaining height differences of at most 1.
- **Red-Black Tree** maintains balance by ensuring an equal number of black nodes in all root-to-leaf paths.

## Special Types of Binary Trees

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** follows these rules:

- The left subtree contains only nodes with values **less** than the parent node.
- The right subtree contains only nodes with values **greater** than the parent node.
- The left and right subtrees must also be BSTs.

### AVL Tree

An **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing BST where the height difference between left and right subtrees of any node is at most **1**.

### Red-Black Tree

A **Red-Black Tree** is a self-balancing BST where:

- Each node is colored **red or black**.
- The tree remains balanced by ensuring specific properties related to the coloring and structure.
- It guarantees O(log n) time complexity for insert, delete, and search operations.

### B-Tree

A **B-Tree** is a self-balancing tree optimized for disk storage and databases. It allows multiple keys per node and supports efficient insertion and deletion operations.

### B+ Tree

A **B+ Tree** is an extension of a B-Tree where:

- All data elements are stored in **leaf nodes**.
- Internal nodes only contain keys for **indexing**.
- It enables faster **range queries** and sequential access.

### Segment Tree

A **Segment Tree** is a data structure used for range queries and modifications. It is mainly used for:

- **Efficient range queries** (e.g., sum, min, max over an interval)
- **Interval updates**

Segment trees offer O(log n) query and update time complexity.
