## Introduction to Binary Tree

A **Binary Tree** is a non-linear and hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the **left child** and the **right child**. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the **root**, and the bottom-most nodes are called **leaves**.

## Representation of Binary Tree

Each node in a Binary Tree consists of three parts:

- **Data**
- **Pointer to the left child**
- **Pointer to the right child**

## Binary Tree Representation

### Create/Declare a Node of a Binary Tree

Syntax to declare a Node of a Binary Tree in different languages:

```cpp
// 1: Using struct
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left, * right;

    Node(int key) {
        data = key;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

// 2: Using class
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* left, * right;

    Node(int key) {
        data = key;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};
```

## Example: Creating a Binary Tree

Here’s an example of creating a Binary Tree with four nodes (2, 3, 4, 5):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node{
    int data;
    Node *left, *right;
    Node(int d){
        data = d;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

int main(){
    // Initialize and allocate memory for tree nodes
    Node* firstNode = new Node(2);
    Node* secondNode = new Node(3);
    Node* thirdNode = new Node(4);
    Node* fourthNode = new Node(5);

    // Connect binary tree nodes
    firstNode->left = secondNode;
    firstNode->right = thirdNode;
    secondNode->left = fourthNode;

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we have created four tree nodes: `firstNode`, `secondNode`, `thirdNode`, and `fourthNode` with values 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

After creating these nodes, we connect them to form the tree structure:

- Connect `secondNode` to the left of `firstNode` → `firstNode->left = secondNode`
- Connect `thirdNode` to the right of `firstNode` → `firstNode->right = thirdNode`
- Connect `fourthNode` to the left of `secondNode` → `secondNode->left = fourthNode`

## Terminologies in Binary Tree

- **Nodes**: Fundamental part of a binary tree, where each node contains data and links to two child nodes.
- **Root**: The topmost node in a tree, serving as the starting point.
- **Parent Node**: A node that has one or more child nodes.
- **Child Node**: A node that is a descendant of another node.
- **Leaf Node**: A node that does not have any children (both left and right pointers are `nullptr`).
- **Internal Node**: A node that has at least one child.
- **Depth of a Node**: The number of edges from a node to the root.
- **Height of a Binary Tree**: The number of nodes from the deepest leaf node to the root.

## Properties of Binary Tree

- The maximum number of nodes at level **L** of a binary tree is **2^L**.
- The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height **H** is **2^H - 1**.
- Total number of leaf nodes = total number of nodes with 2 children + 1.
- In a Binary Tree with **N** nodes, the minimum possible height is **log₂(N+1)**.
- A Binary Tree with **L** leaves has at least **⌊ log₂L ⌋ + 1** levels.

- **Full Binary Tree**
- **Degenerate Binary Tree**

- **Segment Tree**

## Operations On Binary Tree

Following is a list of common operations that can be performed on a binary tree:

### 1. Traversal in Binary Tree

Traversal in Binary Tree involves visiting all the nodes of the binary tree. Tree Traversal algorithms can be classified broadly into two categories: **DFS** and **BFS**.

#### Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithms

DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It is implemented using recursion. The main traversal methods in DFS for binary trees are:

- **Preorder Traversal (current-left-right)**: Visits the node first, then left subtree, then right subtree.
- **Inorder Traversal (left-current-right)**: Visits left subtree, then the node, then the right subtree.
- **Postorder Traversal (left-right-current)**: Visits left subtree, then right subtree, then the node.

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm

BFS explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is typically implemented using a queue. BFS in a binary tree is commonly referred to as **Level Order Traversal**.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left, * right;

    Node(int d) {
        data = d;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

// In-order DFS: Left, Root, Right
void inOrderDFS(Node* node) {
    if (node == nullptr) return;
    inOrderDFS(node->left);
    cout << node->data << " ";
    inOrderDFS(node->right);
}

// Pre-order DFS: Root, Left, Right
void preOrderDFS(Node* node) {
    if (node == nullptr) return;
    cout << node->data << " ";
    preOrderDFS(node->left);
    preOrderDFS(node->right);
}

// Post-order DFS: Left, Right, Root
void postOrderDFS(Node* node) {
    if (node == nullptr) return;
    postOrderDFS(node->left);
    postOrderDFS(node->right);
    cout << node->data << " ";
}

void BFS(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        Node* node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        cout << node->data << " ";
        if (node->left != nullptr) q.push(node->left);
        if (node->right != nullptr) q.push(node->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* root = new Node(2);
    root->left = new Node(3);
    root->right = new Node(4);
    root->left->left = new Node(5);

    cout << "In-order DFS: ";
    inOrderDFS(root);

    cout << "\nPre-order DFS: ";
    preOrderDFS(root);

    cout << "\nPost-order DFS: ";
    postOrderDFS(root);

    cout << "\nLevel order: ";
    BFS(root);

    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```
In-order DFS: 5 3 2 4
Pre-order DFS: 2 3 5 4
Post-order DFS: 5 3 4 2
Level order: 2 3 4 5
```

### 2. Insertion in Binary Tree

Insertion in a binary tree involves adding a new node. Since there is no specific ordering of elements in a binary tree, insertions are typically done level-wise using BFS.

```cpp
Node* insert(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        root = new Node(key);
        return root;
    }
    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        Node* temp = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if (temp->left == nullptr) {
            temp->left = new Node(key);
            break;
        } else {
            q.push(temp->left);
        }
        if (temp->right == nullptr) {
            temp->right = new Node(key);
            break;
        } else {
            q.push(temp->right);
        }
    }
    return root;
}
```

### 3. Searching in Binary Tree

Searching involves looking for a node with a specific value using traversal methods like DFS or BFS.

```cpp
bool searchDFS(Node *root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr) return false;
    if (root->data == value) return true;
    return searchDFS(root->left, value) || searchDFS(root->right, value);
}
```

### 4. Deletion in Binary Tree

Deletion involves finding the node, replacing it with the last node, and removing the last node.

```cpp
Node* deleteNode(Node* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;
    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);
    Node* target = nullptr;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        Node* curr = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if (curr->data == val) {
            target = curr;
            break;
        }
        if (curr->left) q.push(curr->left);
        if (curr->right) q.push(curr->right);
    }
    if (target == nullptr) return root;
    delete target;
    return root;
}
```
