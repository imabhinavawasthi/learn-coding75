# What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way to organize and store data in a computer so it can be used efficiently. It helps in storing, processing, and retrieving data easily.

## Uses of Data Structures

Data structures are used in many areas, such as:

- **Databases**: Organizing and storing data for quick access.
- **Operating Systems**: Managing memory and files.
- **Computer Graphics**: Storing and displaying shapes and images.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Representing knowledge and information.

## Benefits of Using Data Structures

- **Faster Processing**: Helps in quick data storage and retrieval.
- **Easy Modification**: Data can be easily changed when needed.
- **Reusable**: Can be used in multiple programs.
- **Better Maintenance**: Makes programs easier to understand and update.

## Types of Data Structures

### 1. Primitive Data Structures

These are the basic types provided by programming languages:

- **Integer**: Whole numbers.
- **Float**: Decimal numbers.
- **Character**: Single letter or symbol.
- **Boolean**: True or false values.
- **String**: Sequence of characters.

### 2. Non-Primitive Data Structures

These store multiple values and can be complex:

#### **Linear Data Structures**

Data is arranged in a sequence.

- **Array**: A fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
- **Stack**: Follows **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** order.
- **Queue**: Follows **First In, First Out (FIFO)** order.
- **Linked List**: A collection of connected elements using pointers.

  - **Static Data Structure**: Fixed memory size (e.g., Array).
  - **Dynamic Data Structure**: Memory size changes during runtime (e.g., Queue, Stack).

#### **Non-Linear Data Structures**

Data is arranged in a non-sequential way.

- **Tree**: A structure with a parent-child relationship.
- **Graph**: A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

## Common Data Structures Explained

1. **Array**: Stores multiple values in continuous memory locations.
2. **Linked List**: Stores data elements connected by pointers.
3. **Stack**: A collection where the last added item is removed first (LIFO).
   - **Operations**: `push()`, `pop()`, `top()`, `size()`, `isEmpty()`.
4. **Queue**: A collection where the first added item is removed first (FIFO).
   - **Operations**: `Enqueue()`, `Dequeue()`, `front()`, `rear()`, `isFull()`, `isNull()`.
5. **Binary Tree**: A tree where each node has up to two children.
6. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A tree where the left child contains smaller values and the right child contains larger values.
7. **Heap**: A complete binary tree used for fast access to the largest or smallest value.
8. **Hash Table**: Uses a special function (hash function) to map keys to values for fast access.
9. **Matrix**: A table of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
10. **Trie**: A tree-based structure used for fast searching.
11. **Graph**: Represents relationships between objects using nodes and edges.
