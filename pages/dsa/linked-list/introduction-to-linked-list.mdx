# Linked List Data Structure

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue, and deque.

## Comparison: Linked List vs Arrays

### Linked List:

- **Data Structure:** Non-contiguous
- **Memory Allocation:** Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
- **Insertion/Deletion:** Efficient
- **Access:** Sequential

### Array:

- **Data Structure:** Contiguous
- **Memory Allocation:** Typically allocated to the whole array
- **Insertion/Deletion:** Inefficient
- **Access:** Random
