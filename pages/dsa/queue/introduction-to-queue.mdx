# Introduction to Queue Data Structure

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. This means that the first element added is the first one removed, just like a line of people waiting for ticketsâ€”whoever arrives first gets served first.

## Key Concepts

- **Front:** The position of the first element in the queue, which will be removed next.
- **Rear:** The position of the last element in the queue, where new elements are added.
- **Size:** The current number of elements in the queue.
- **Capacity:** The maximum number of elements the queue can hold.

## Queue Operations

`enqueue()`: Add an element

1. Check if the queue is full.
2. If not, move the rear pointer to the next position.
3. Insert the new element at the rear.

`dequeue()`: Remove an element

1. Check if the queue is empty.
2. If not, remove the element at the front.
3. Move the front pointer to the next element.

`peek()`: Get the front element without removing it.\
`size()`: Get the number of elements in the queue.\
`isEmpty()`: Check if the queue is empty.\
`isFull()`: Check if the queue is full.\

## Implementing a Queue

Queues can be implemented using:

- **Arrays** (fixed size, may cause overflow)
- **Linked Lists** (dynamic size, no overflow)

### Time Complexity of Operations

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Enqueue   | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Dequeue   | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Peek      | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Size      | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| isEmpty   | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| isFull    | O(1)            | O(1)             |

## Types of Queues

1. **Simple Queue:** Follows FIFO; elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
2. **Double-Ended Queue (Deque):** Allows insertion and deletion from both ends.
   - **Input Restricted Queue:** Input only from one end, deletion from both ends.
   - **Output Restricted Queue:** Input from both ends, deletion only from one end.
3. **Circular Queue:** The last position is connected back to the first, allowing reuse of spaces.
4. **Priority Queue:** Elements are processed based on priority.
   - **Ascending Priority Queue:** Smallest priority element is removed first.
   - **Descending Priority Queue:** Largest priority element is removed first.

## Real-World Applications of Queues

Queues are used in many practical scenarios, including:

- **Task Scheduling:** Managing processes in a CPU.
- **Printer Queues:** Handling multiple print requests in order.
- **Network Buffers:** Managing data packets in routers and switches.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Used in graph traversal algorithms.
- **Call Centers:** Handling customer service requests in order.
