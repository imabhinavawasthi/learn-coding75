# BFS of Graph

## Problem Statement

Given an **undirected graph** represented by an **adjacency list** `adj`, perform a **Breadth First Traversal (BFS)** starting from vertex `0`. The traversal should follow the order of nodes as they appear in the adjacency list.

### Example 1

```ts
Input: adj = [[2, 3, 1], [0], [0, 4], [0], [2]];
Output: [0, 2, 3, 1, 4];
```

**Explanation:**

1. Start at `0` → Output: `[0]`
2. Visit `2` (first neighbor of `0`) → `[0, 2]`
3. Visit `3` → `[0, 2, 3]`
4. Visit `1` → `[0, 2, 3, 1]`
5. Visit `4` (neighbor of `2`) → `[0, 2, 3, 1, 4]`

### Example 2

```ts
Input: adj = [[1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1, 3, 4], [2], [2]];
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
```

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ adj.size() ≤ 10^4`
- `1 ≤ adj[i][j] ≤ 10^4`

## Understanding BFS (Breadth-First Search)

- BFS is a **level-order traversal technique**, meaning it explores all neighbors of a node before moving deeper into the graph.
- It uses a **queue** to keep track of nodes to be explored.
- A **visited array** ensures each node is visited only once.

## Solution Approach

1. **Initialize data structures:**
   - `vis[]` (visited array) to mark visited nodes.
   - `queue<int> q` to store nodes in BFS order.
   - `vector<int> bfs` to store the final traversal order.
2. **Start BFS from node `0`:**
   - Mark node `0` as visited.
   - Push `0` into the queue.
3. **BFS Traversal:**
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue a node.
     - Add it to the BFS result.
     - Iterate over its adjacent nodes:
       - If a neighbor is not visited, mark it visited and push it into the queue.
4. **Return the BFS traversal list.**

## C++ Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> bfsOfGraph(vector<vector<int>> &adj) {
        int v = adj.size();
        int vis[v] = {0};
        vis[0] = 1;
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(0);
        vector<int> bfs;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            bfs.push_back(node);
            for (auto it : adj[node]) {
                if (!vis[it]) {
                    vis[it] = 1;
                    q.push(it);
                }
            }
        }
        return bfs;
    }
};
```

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(V + E)` (where `V` = number of vertices, `E` = number of edges)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V)` (queue, visited array, BFS result vector)
